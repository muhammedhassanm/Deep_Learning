    "I like to draw an **analogy** between the **Dirichlet Distribution** and the **normal distribution**, since most people understand the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is a probability distribution over all the real numbers. It is described by a mean and a variance. The mean is the expected value of this distribution, and the variance tells us how much we can expect samples to deviate from the mean. If the variance is very high, then you’re going to see values that are both much smaller than the mean and much larger than the mean. If the variance is small, then the samples will be very close to the mean. If the variance goes close to zero, all samples will be almost exactly at the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dirichlet distribution is a probability distribution as well - but it is not sampling from the space of real numbers. Instead it is sampling over a probability simplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what is a probability simplex? It’s a bunch of numbers that add up to 1. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "(0.6, 0.4)\n",
    "(0.1, 0.1, 0.8)\n",
    "(0.05, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers represent probabilities over K distinct categories. In the above examples, K is 2, 3, and 6 respectively. That’s why they are also called categorical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are dealing with categorical distributions and we have some uncertainty over what that distribution is, simplest way to represent that uncertainty as a probability distribution is the Dirichlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "A K-dimentional Dirichlet distribution has K parameters. These parameters can be any positive number. For example, a 4-dimentional Dirichlet may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "(23, 6, 32, 39)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the normal case, the mean and the variance tell us what kind of samples to expect. What do the above parameters tell us? Note that these 4 parameters can be normalized (divided by their sum) to form a probability distribution times a normalization constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "100 * (0.23, 0.06, 0.32, 0.39)\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities that come out of it (23%, 6%, 32%, 39%) just happen to be the mean value of the Dirichlet! So, all samples from it will center around that simplex. The normalization constant - 100 in this case - isn’t the variance but it’s related. The higher it is, the closer samples will be to the mean. 100 is a fairly high weight, so most samples from this distribution will be close to (23%, 6%, 32%, 39%).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the normalization constant gets very low (close the zero) the variance gets higher and higher. The furthest you can get from a point in the simplex is usually in one of the corners, for example (0, 0, 1, 0). When the normalization constant gets low, not only do we expect to be far away from the mean. We actually expect to flip to one of the corners of the simplex with probabilities as described by the mean.\n",

I begin to receive letter from my employer that suttell and hammer are the responsible party, so I contact suttell and hammer, to make a negotiation because I ca n't afford the amount of what they are taken from my paycheck, so how I am supposed to live everything 's food and rent car payment is high as well I got family. I talked to their account manager XXXX XXXX, and another person I forgot her name, but they both began to be surprised, when I told them that I lived in the state of Texas for 7 year already, then they told me that they do n't do any business to any resident in the state of Texas, they thought I lived in Washington state. after that they told me they will relinquish the debt collection and will inform XXXX credit card company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that they can not do collection on me because Texas is not their jurisdiction of operation. At this time after I may contacted with adp wages department of XXXX XXXX XXXX, telling them I made contact with the debt collector that they will send paper work to not take wager from my paycheck. is still a progress the debt collector informed me that it will take 9 day for them to do the paper work to forward it to the adp wage department of XXXX XXXX XXXX. finally I begin to make contact with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX they informed me that I can do a complaint with the FTC.gov as well they told me that the state of Texas has a restricted law on debt collector ability to garnish wages from pay check in relation ship to credit card debt.\\nhere is what the law of Texas informed me \\\" Your home and wages : Some collectors will threaten to take your home or wages to pay for a debt. In Texas, if your residence has been declared a homestead, it can not be taken to pay a debt except for debts taken for the purchase of the home ( ie, a mortgage in default ), for home improvements, for home equity loans or to pay certain taxes. Wages may be garnished only to pay debts related to court-ordered child support, back taxes, and defaulted student loans. Debt collectors can not garnish wages for repayment of consumer debt.\\n\\\" also I learned the status of limitation for debt collection is 4 year in Texas and in Washington is 6 year, debt incursion was in XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX, so I way pass the status of limitation for both state. What really crooked about the Suttell and Hammer is that they file a sue against me in a state that I do n't live in or ca n't appear in the court and speak for me to defend my self. Further more I did n't get any notification at all. So is a one side relationship that they are always win and no one can object to anythings they said, is very unfair and is not right by common law. I also attached document picture from the Debt collector as well the Document picture from the internet related to the Garnishment law of Texas and status of limitation for debt collectors also a paycheck stub to show the credit card debt collector garnished my wages. Again thank you\",\"I was financed through Ally Financial for my XX/XX/XXXX auto loan from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX when my loan was paid off. throughout the agreement I made monthly payments by my due date on the XXXX or by the 10 day grace period which is the XXXX. At one point when I didnt make a payment by the due date or the grace period Ally third party called me over 100 times with in that month at all times of the day. after the 1st call, I made payment arrangements that apparently was not updated into their system because they kept calling. After maybe the 20th call I informed them that I had made payment arrangements and to please stop harassing me with the frequent phone calls. the calls never stopped. I would receive calls as early as XXXX until XXXX at night all throughout the day until eventually I started blocking the multiple numbers the company would call me from. these harassing phone calls from Ally Financial has caused me stress, and paranoia due to the threatening phone calls and letters to seize my car and and the late fees and penalties I incurred while while my financial hardship. Under no circumstances should a customer be harassed and annoyed such as I was with phone calls early enough and late enough to disturb me from my sleep. So nonetheless I worked hard to pay off my debt owed at Ally. A check was sent to Ally Financial on XX/XX/XXXX to complete this payment and on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I received phone calls from Ally. On XX/XX/XXXX I informed them that a check was sent to them paying my car loan off and that they should update my account reflecting a zero balance. They agreed but I continued to receive calls. I told the same thing again that day and the next two days they called. Finally on the XX/XX/XXXX they called early that morning waking me up out of my sleep and I finally gave them the tracking number and the person who who signed for the check at XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and they hung up on me. I called back and they hung up again. I checked my online account and it finally said XXXX balance. Now that I am no longer a customer I would still like to be refunded for my rights as a consumer. I had to block approximately XXXX different numbers from Ally Financial and third parties calling to collect a debt after I told them they were harassing me and I would no longer like for them to call me. I filed a XXXX complaint which they responded no agreeing to pay me anything because they nver meant to harass me they were just making several attempts to contact me but of course I would n't answer because I already asked them to stop calling and they never did stop until my account was paid off. they charged me over {$10000.00} in late fees, interest and penalties and I am seeking that amount back.My total amount I am asking to be refunded is {$10000.00}.

Since\",\"My mortgage contract states that automatic termination of PMI is to be XX/XX/2017. As of XX/XX/2017, my servicer, Bank of America ( BoA ), refuses to take it off immediately. Instead they have told me various confusing things, such as, I have to pay two more months of PMI past XX/XX/2017, or that I do n't have to pay past XX/XX/2017, or I have to pay one more month of PMI past XX/XX/2017. All the while saying they ca n't provide documentation on definite dates and it has to go through more days of review. \\n\\nI first contacted them on XX/XX/2017 to find out why the updated amortization schedule had PMI on it for the entire 2017 year. Since then they have continually dragged my case on. I have contacted them six times already with no definite documented resolutions to terminate PMI by XX/XX/XXXX, only possibilities leading to paying more money outside the stated termination date. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/2017, I have been told that it can be up to another 14 business days to get my PMI off my account. Conveniently for BoA, the additional \\\" review '' days put me around XX/XX/XXXX, so I am held hostage to either pay XX/XX/XXXX PMI or a late fee ( after XX/XX/XXXX ). There is a possibility, at that time, they may try to drag this out longer, which is a related concern. \\n\\nAll I ask is that the legal contract we signed many years ago be honored. It states, \\\" If you are current on your loan payments, PMI will automatically terminate on the date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 78 % of the original value of the property. This date is XX/XX/2017. '' I am current on my loan payments.

I informed her that I did indeed know her intent for calling although I was unaware of any outstanding debt owed to said company. She again referenced a \\\" felony criminal case '' at which point I informed her that she was violating the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act by threatening to have me arrested or taken to jail. XXXX XXXX then became very short and said she would be transferring me to an attorney at their office. I was transferred to \\\" XXXX XXXX '' who identified himself as \\\" Attorney XXXX ''.

He also repeatedly asked if I would like to make a statement or if I was able to prove that some sort of identity theft may have occurred. I told XXXX XXXX that I would have my attorney get in contact with him to discuss further. At that point he wished me luck and hung up. I then proceeded to contact the Texas Attorney General 's office regarding our call where I was informed that this is a very regular scam that occurs and the State of Texas does not have \\\" debtors prison ''.

I then attempted to locate said law firm online using their phone number, name, location and was unable to locate anything.

After yelling to someone in the background \\\" Do we have an XXXX XXXX here? '' he proceeded to tell me that she did indeed work there, but was not in at the moment and could he help me. I again asked for proof of the debt, but he stated I needed to talk to the attorney again ( who he also named as XXXX XXXX ). I requested to speak with XXXX XXXX and also for his bar number.

I explained the situation, I was told I had  made a mistake and they only offer 0 % on balance transfers NOT on purchases. I explained to her that she was incorrect and the actual information was on their own company website. She verified and confirmed that I am correct and am supposed to have 0 % APR on purchases AND balance transfers. She confirmed she put a notice on my account to be corrected. On XX/XX/XXXX I called customer support for the 2nd time. Again, I explained the situation, she said that the note was still on my account and it was being processed. I should notice my interest charges removed from my account on the next billing cycle. Unfortunately, I trusted her and did n't check until recently. Because I was having no success contacting them by phone, I used their \\\" Secure Messaging '' system for support. I explained the entire situation again and how I had previously not been assisted. Their response : \\\" Although we show no 0 % APR offer for purchases, we can confirm that your account was eligible for a 0 % introductory APR for the first fifteen billing cycles following each balance transfer that posted to your account within the first 45 days after your account open date ...

I 'm not allowed to know who is researching and why this time when they research it will be any different than the other times I have called. Unfortunately, they now are requiring me to send in my original terms and conditions for the card, that I received in the mail, but I honestly do n't think I 'll be able to find it.

I was young and naive on the process and was able to obtain a loan with no cosigner at the time. XXXX was not accredited when I went and the loans were not able to be consolidated. When I graduated I struggled to find work. It was time to pay my loans and they minimum payment was over {$1000.00} for XXXX loans. Most private loans which I had no idea any would be private. I paid my federal loans fine since they were only {$99.00} a month. I was told to use my deferment option until my loan was able to be consolidated. I deferred the loan collecting tons of interest in fear it would default since I could not pay the {$1000.00} loan payments. Eventually I was able to consolidate and my loans were now {$350.00} a month. I found a job in my industry and made payments. I was laid off after 4 months due to down sizing. Out of XXXX employees XXXX were laid off. I was again unable to pay my loans. I once again had to defer my payments. My deferment ran out before I found another job. I pleaded to arrange a payment plan to allow me to pay only interest until I find work. They would not help me. My payments fell behind to almost {$2000.00} minimum payment. I found a job and pleaded with them once again to allow me to make payments on this amount. They told me I would continue to build interest to ask a family member or get a loan for the amount I need to get caught up again. I was unable to do either.

They are demanding {$34000.00} minimum payment in order for me to get back in good standings and make monthly payments on the principle. I am unable to purchase a home or make any large purchases because of this. I make enough money to pay my loans but they refuse to give me any options for repayment.

The Pre Approval Notice was issued to aid in purchasing a pre-existing or new home. The Pre Approval Notice was issued for a Loan Type of a FHA XXXX Fixed. This allowed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( borrowers ) to purchase a new home to be constructed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In mid XXXX 2014, the borrows were told by XXXX XXXX if Guild Mortgage Company, they did not qualify for a FHA 30 Year Fixed loan due to already having a FHA XXXX Fixed Loan on their existing home they were living in. The buyers were told they must sell they home to qualify for the new home being built. This was the XXXX the buyers had heard anything about having to sell there home to qualify for the one being built by XXXX XXXX. In fact XXXX XXXX XXXX had a policy of not building homes if the buyers had a home contingent upon selling. Therefore, the building would have never been initiated without a the Pre Approval Letter stating we qualified for a FHA 30 year Fixed loan. There were no pre conditions listed we would have to sell our existing home. We had given the title company {$14000.00} in earnest money to build the new home. If we attempted to terminate the contract we stood to loose the {$14000.00} and possibly more. We finally qualified ( with a couple of weeks or less before closing ) for a conventional loan and would have to carry both the old and new mortgages unless we were able to sell the existing home. In order to qualify for the conventional loan, we spent {$6000.00} from savings in an attempt to qualify and keep our automobile. This process did not work. So we had to sell our automobile back to the dealership for a {$8000.00} loss and we had to pay approximately {$5000.00} extra in closing costs so our debt ratio would satisfy the underwriters. We still have not sold our old home and have been paying an extra mortgage payment, utilities, etc.. We have lost an additional {$4200.00} dollars and are in the process of selling the home. To sell the home we had to lower the price to a point where we will be losing approximately {$18000.00} to close the deal. \\n\\nNone of this would have taken place had Guild Mortgage Company and XXXX XXXX XXXX been honest and issued the correct Pre Approval. Recently, ( within two weeks ) I called and talked to XXXX XXXX and asked why he did not know we did not qualify for XXXX FHA loans. He informed he did know and the only reason he wrote the Pre Qualification Notice the way he did was due to XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX telling him she could sell the house anytime and therefore the loan type would not make a difference. We the buyers never agree nor knew of these dealings behind our backs. \\n\\nPlease consider this most disgusting act committed against XXXX XXXX persons and take the appropriate actions you deem necessary to provide us with some help.

With the mold posing significant health hazard for us, we immediately left the property and never returned nor used the timeshare again. We immediately began to file several complaints with XXXX XXXX notifying them of the breach of contract by their actions to which they fail to respond or even acknowledge. We also notify them of other promises that were made during the sales and never delivered. Because we live away from Florida, XXXX has employed every tactics in the books to pressure us to pay maintenance fee for a Timeshare we never used in the 19 years and yet fully paid. XXXX has done nothing to compensate us for our loss and pain since we purchased this agreement. All they have done is pressured us to sign the deed over to them and walk away. We refused. As a result they tried to foreclose illegally in XX/XX/XXXX and we signed an obligor 's right to object to the use of the trustee foreclosure proceedings dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( document attached ) without our presence. XXXX XXXX went ahead and illegally and fraudulently obtained the foreclosure without our right to present our case before the trustee. This is why we believe Experian is wrong in reporting this foreclosure on our credit records on the basis of an illegally obtained foreclosure. Because we live outside of the State of Florida, we have had difficulty retaining an attorney to secure our funds from XXXX XXXX. I believe we have found someone who is willing to take this case now if XXXX and Experian continue to ignore the XXXX page document showing the detailed complaints filed with XXXX XXXX over the years.

Thank you\",\"This complaint is against Capital One Credit Card negative account in my credit report. This negative account is hurting my credit, but makes a false claim. I do not owe Capital One any monies : Capital One was the first to brake the terms of the credit card agreement. In fact, Capital One has already taken this claim to court and the case was dismissed. Capital One claim is just wrong. \\n\\nCapital One broke the terms of the credit card when they deny my right to dispute a charge in my account. In 2010, I moved and was scamed by the moving company shiiping my stuff : in order to deliver my stuff, the merchant demanded a cash payment, when I had already paid for all merchant 's services with my credit card. Consequently, I disputed merchant 's charge on my Capital One credit card. However, Capital One denied my right, per the card 's terms and conditions, to dispute the charge. \\n\\nIn order to deny my right to dispute the moving company 's charge, Capital One requested additional information ( which I had already provided in previous corresondence ) and only allowed me 24 hours to submit it, else Capital One would close the dispute. Capital One requested additional documents in a letter dated XXXX XXXX 2010. The letter was delivered on XXXX XXXX 2010 and it required the supporting documents to be received by XXXX XXXX 2010. Since I was out of the country ( as Capital One could have guessed from the charges in my credit card ), I did not find out about the 24 hours deadline to provide supporting documents, until it had expired. I was still able to submit the requested document within a week. However, Capital One disregarded my submission and closed the case. I filed a complaint argueing it was not reasonable I was only given 24 hours to reply Capital One 's request. I wanted Capital One to continue my dispute against the moving company. Capital One gave the excuse the time XXXX allows them to process the dispute was very short and to meet that timeframe they could only allow me 24 hours to reply their request for supporting material. This was all a lie by Capital one. I called XXXX and was told they do not set time limits to process disputes. in any case, I had filed my dispute less than 3 months after the credit card charge and my submission of suporting documents was less than 5 months after the credit card charge. Nevertheless, Capital One insisted to close the dispute, removed the temporary credit I had received and demanded I pay that charge. Since I considered Capital One had not respected my rights and had broken the terms of the credit card, by denying my right to dispute a charge, I informed Capital One I was not going to pay that charge and was not going to use my credit card ever again. Capital One very quickly added late fees and finance charges, until the balance reached around {$1500.00} and they charged the account off. \\n\\nCapital One continued demanding I pay the card 's balance in full. but I never agreed to Capital One 's claims. Eventually, Capital One realized that and decided to take its claim to court : the case was dismissed. So should now this negative account from my credit report, since Capital One 's claim is wrong. \\n\\nAs a side note not relevant to this credit report dispute, I need to say it is really unfortunate, Capital One Dispute Department is the worst from all credit card companies I have ever dealt with. I had already had previous experiences where Capital One Dispute Department was very incompetent and unhelpful. I liked my Capital One credit card. It had good conditions and I used to use it a lot. I was a good client and was never late in my payments. However, I had to give it up as I found unacceptable Capital One would let me down : they denied my right to dispute an incorrect charge and so allowed some merchant to scam me.\",\"I opened an account on Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 after visiting Bank of America to cash a payroll check.

That card was cancelled and a new one was issued. \\n\\nBOA returned the XXXX and XXXX transactions, but informed me that the XXXX transaction had to post to my account and that I would then need to dispute the transaction. After 3 days of repeatedly calling BOA to have the XXXX transaction cancelled and to not be funded, they still refused to do so. The transaction showed as posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, so I called in to file the dispute and I explained to the representative that I was out of state and would be until XX/XX/XXXX and that the dispute affidavit would need to be mailed to the address I was staying at. The dispute affidavit finally arrived the second week of XX/XX/XXXX after additional phone inquiries requesting the form. I completed the form on XX/XX/XXXX, and returned via mail. It is Dispute Claim : XXXX. \\n\\nA temporary credit was issued to my account on XX/XX/XXXX by BOA. BOA rescinded the temporary credit on XX/XX/XXXX without notifying me before hand at my business/home address, or by phone or email. \\n\\nI had verbally disputed the fraudulent charge ( s ) prior to the transaction hard posting to my account, however, BOA did not take action to return the fraudulent transaction upon my notification that it was fraudulent and prior to actual item posting and is now saying that I am at fault and therefore out the funds. \\n\\nAs a XXXX, I feel that I should be extended the same protection as granted to a consumer. I took the appropriate action to notify BOA of the fraudulent transaction in a timely manner. They failed to take the proper action to deny the fraudulent transaction, as they had done with XXXX, and XXXX. \\nAs a loyal, 24 year account holder with Bank of America, I should, and expect to receive a refund the full amount of the fraudulent transaction ( {$1800.00} ), and I would like to participate in prosecuting those responsible for committing these crimes. \\n\\nPoints of Contact : BOA Claims Dept. - XXXX XXXX Local BOA Branch : XXXX Relationship Manager XXXX FL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX County Sherriff 's Dep : Deputy XXXX XXXX\",\"FYI, there not much of a selection for the specific issue of this misrepresented matter so therefore I went with the best possible selection by selecting there should be no response to lawsuit. \\n\\nI settled a debt XXXX/XXXX/2014. The settled in full letter provided Is not sufficient according to the credit bureaus. The credit bureaus will not acknowledge the letter due to the debt collector being a third party who is representing another third party and the letter lists the original creditor as well as the full original account number.

Do not tell consumers a letter proving the debt has been resolved will suffice. Very misleading and is a violation of the fdcpa. If I am telling this business the letter is not working they should make an effort to resolve the issue such as contacting the debt purchaser, who will not answer the phone, to resolve the issue. I also tried contacting the original creditor and I ca n't get any confirmation of this debt was even place with this agency and the fact praxis is not willing to contact the bureaus or help rectify the issue is a red flag.\",\"Equifax and   XXXX   show my score over  XXXX  points below  XXXX .

The attorneys representing us XXXX XXXX and XXXX warned us that despite good PR, Wells Fargo was the greatest offender of all the mortgage institutions : Our toxic Pick-a-Pay, negative amortization mortgage was owned XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo acquired them XXXX XXXX XXXX see link below : XXXX The nail in the coffin for us is when WFBank- who knew they were covering up for fraudulent loan servicing succeeded in removing our Mortgage fraud case from California State court to Federal court using a legal loophole claiming another Wells Fargo 's corporate office in Iowa in addition to the fact the original mortgage with XXXX had been located in Texas. The federal the courts are more protective of the banks than State court. Despite all this the federal judge granted us the opportunity to sue for fraud against WFB : Our counsel advised that it would drag on cost us a lot of money- but then WFB threatened that if we did not prevail a year or so from our filing that we would be responsible for XXXX to {$10000.00} dollars of their attorneys fees! We were compelled to sign a waiver that we could not sue WF in the future civilly, however leaving the door open for class action. \\nIt has recently come to my attention that my Loan Mod rep and accountant was successful in obtaining Loan Mods for twenty other of her clients each of whom had equity in their homes, which was the only reason WFB gave for denying us. In XXXX when our property was appraised at {$570000.00} less than the {$670000.00} on the mortgage that WFB rather than issuing a denial that they really could n't do- kept stalling asking for additional signature pages while moving to foreclose forcing us into bankruptcy. At the conclusion of the bankruptcy in XXXX XXXX the judge valued our house on the bankruptcy schedules thereby eliminating WF 's objections and suggested we proceed in loan mod negotiations. \\nDespite WFB response to you and the office of consumer affairs WFB had no intentions of granting is a modification -Even the reps at the Dept of the Treasury/HUD said we we were eligible for a HAMP mod, To quote the attorneys who represented us \\\" It 's simple-Wells Fargo simply wants your property '' We are devastated-There was also notary fraud- the Notary that signed my docs said she \\\" lost '' her notary book- and She did not report it to the Calif.

This was an emergency clean up, for a couple who 's elderly parent was coming from XXXX. This was a Thursday, and I needed the service for the next day, Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 by XXXX. There was only a booking page and I booked the service. When I received the confirmation, it was scheduled for the next Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. I immediately emailed the company and told them this needed to be cancelled because I needed the service the next day. I have all of the emails. When they finally contacted me, the Customer Support, via email, said they would contact the XXXX company to try to accomodate the request. After going back and forth, they could not clean the home on the day needed. Not at one time during the emails with customer support did they tell me, in any way, that I could not get a refund. While waiting, I decided to chat with their on-line chat specialist. She is the one that said I could not get a refund, just a credit. At this time, I contacted my credit card company, Capital One ( XXXX ) .They issued the {$90.00} credit to my account while they contacted the merchant. A few weeks later, the merchant sent them some information, and they re-charged my account the {$90.00}. I was then told to send them all the info. I had ( which were emails ), there was never a receipt or terms and conditions, just an email confirmation. I sent these items on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The next day, the Capital One representatives told me that the merchant sent them terms and conditions and that the charge is non-refundable. This is not right. They never provided me with these terms and conditions and I have never used their service and definitely, I will never use their service. They are forcing me to pay for a service I never used and do n't want with vague, policies that they do not disclose upfront. Obviously, Capital One can not handle the situation. However, this XXXX company has n't provided any service and I am not paying for a service. I have paid all of my capital one balance except {$90.00} so that when this is resolved I can close this card.

These are the various issues which should be investigated : 1. Change in pay structure for Loan Consultants ( LCs ) where they are NOT paid on loans closing. The LC 's name is listed on the loan but is not compensated. \\n2. With the name of the LC on the loan, they are cut-off from the back end of the loan process where the LC is technically still liable for anything that might go wrong. \\n3. This new management would allow for a Pricing Exception ( PE ) for the new hires they brought on board and for a family-related co-worker in XXXX XXXX. However the same level of PE was not made available to other co-workers who had been with Caliber Home Loans for a longer period of time prior to the start date of new management. \\n4. This new management would hire on their own new contacts almost all under the age of XXXX and almost all Male ; conversely new management would disincentivize and push-out the older LCs who have been employed there for a long period of time. This is widely viewed as an act of nepotism along with age and gender discrimination. \\n5. ***This new management terminated a Manager in XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 without sufficient justification. This manager as a result was put on Administrative leave still accepting pay for an extended period of time since there was not just cause after further review with HR. \\n6. ***This new management would also terminate long-standing Loan Consultants in XXXX XXXX prior to year-end 2016 who have a strong historical record of performance over a period of years at Caliber Home Loans.\",\"mrc receivables too me to court over a debt.

This debt is also more than 7 years old from the original creditor.\",\"HOW CREDIT LIMIT DECREASES ARE HANDLED : This is an abusive practice committed by most credit card companies that calls for government regulation. Discover Bank decided to decrease my credit limit to my current balance on  XXXX   XXXX , while I was on vacation. They sent a letter to my home, which takes days to arrive. They made no effort to email, text or call me - methods that would actually notify me in a timely manner. I continued to use my card, as I was unaware of the change in credit limit, and Discover continued to approve my purchases. I learned about the changed limit when my card was declined on  XXXX   XXXX , a stupid way to inform your customers but better than a letter mailed snail-mail to home - I wo n't get that until I finish my vacation. They listed my account as overdrawn, said when I called to complain that they  may h ave already reported my account as overdrawn to credit bureaus and the representative would n't do anything about that, and I am still subject to penalty APRs and harmful credit reports should they decide to do so at a later date.     Note that there is NO REASONABLE WAY to have avoided this, as  Discover  did nothing to contact me other than send me snail mail or wait for me to log into my account, which I do n't do every day. Additionally, I will have to pay the last 4 days of charges which are now listed as \\\" overlimit '' amounts, essentially forcing me to use cash to cover these transactions I wanted covered on credit.     Needed regulation from CFPB :   1 ) Credit line decreases should require repeated attempts to contact the cardholder by all available means. Snail mail is not sufficient.\\n2 ) Any charges above the new limit which are approved after the new credit line is set should automatically raise the credit limit to the amount approved, rather than being considered \\\" overlimit. '' 3 ) Any a  pproved charges within a time period after the change ( say, 1 month ) causing the balance to rise above the new limit but below the previous limit should not cause the account to be listed as overdrawn with any company or credit bureau, including the issuer.      Stretch goal : Credit card companies should not be able to drop credit limits without warning. People rely on their credit limits as available funds when planning their lives. They may be on vacation, expecting to use that amount for emergencies, or even to get home. Credit card companies should have to consider credit limits as already borrowed and thus should n't be able to drop limits without sufficient warning, say a full billing cycle. This allows people to plan and not be left high and dry with a sudden limit decrease. While credit card companies may howl that this will induce some people to max out their cards and expose the company to more risk,  which is true, this should be seen as a normal credit risk of issuing credit cards. Consider the money already loaned when a credit limit was originally approved.\",\"I have obtained Lowe 's credit card : XXXX First statement was paid in full.

Earlier this year we tried to refinance our home through Bank of America but was turned down because there was not enough value in our home. My First mortgage is current along with all my other accounts. We have continued to make our monthly payment on the B of A Home Equity Line of Credit at the same payment of the interest only amount. Bank of America has turned us down for four home loan modifications. Bank of America customer service staff has threaten to begin foreclosure procedures if the payment are not brought current.

I have tons of paperwork and emails and even recorded conversations with Suntrust and XXXX showing my efforts and their lack thereof to get my loan modification completed so that I can make my payments! Suntrust is intentionally withholding my final loan modification documents from XXXX. Suntrust had already gone so far as to change my interest rate to the modified rate prior to the transfer to XXXX, however XXXX is reflecting the original interest rate, but the final executed loan mod docs that allowed for the changed rate are now unable to be located?!?!

I spent nearly 3 months with them submitting documents and sometimes waiting weeks for a response. After the last call from my processor ( XXXX XXXX ) I did not received any other communication from them. I recently learned SOFI called my property insurance company, XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX and  requested they change the Mortgage Company to SOFI and  to send the bills directly to me. Due to this error by SOFI, I just received a notice of cancellation from XXXX. My current mortgage company is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I pay escrow for taxes and insurance. XXXX stopped billing XXXX due to SOFI 's request. XXXX has been using a 3rd party showing my insurance was past due and has been paying it monthly but they have been paying late. Therefore, XXXX sent a notice of cancellation. I also learned that SOFI requested an expedited payoff demand from XXXX and I was charged {$30.00} for the request which was refunded to me by XXXX after I explained what happened. I am complaining to the CFPB because SOFI 's actions do not seem right. I also find it hard to accept that XXXX would make such a change without my knowledge.

I make a monthly payment however, it 's not the payment amount that the company want me to pay. I have my debt responsibilities to maintain. As a result of me only paying between $ XXXX {$60.00} dollars monthly, my credit score took a hard hit. I received between 5-8 calls daily from Navient. I hit the ceiling when they told me that I had {$10000.00} available on a credit card and why ca n't I make a payment with this card. They did n't say the name of the card but I knew what card they were referring to. The customer representative has said this to me the months of XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX. These people continually threaten me with court action and that they will have my salary garnished and any tax returns garnished. I have always had a high credit score however, as a result of me only making the small monthly payment, my credit score has plummeted. They say that they want to work with me, I keep telling them that I ca n't make a higher payment. I have my bills to pay as well as my living and commuting expenses. I refuse to give them my salary information. This seems to anger them. They even ask me if I have someone else helping me with my expenses ( I do n't ) I live paycheck to paycheck frugally. These people also dislike it when I tell them to review the recording on past months. I tell them the same thing over and over again. As I previously stated, I make a small payment monthly, I ca n't go any higher, I need to maintain my bills and living expenses. I can not afford an attorney. Navient is wrong, I feel, looking at my credit report and saying that they see that I maintain my bills but refuse to pay them. When I say that I ca n't make a higher payment then they say \\\" so you 're refusing to make a payment \\\". I have told them that they are twisting and playing on words by saying this. This happens every month. My daughter hopes to start a new job in a few weeks. She is very timid. She cries when these people talk to her so now she wo n't talk at all to them. Once she starts working, she will make her payments. The payments will not be the payments that Navient want ( she too will have living expenses ) but payments will be made.

I have contacted FedLoan Servicing multiple times via phone and e-mail in regards to paying ahead and never get the same answer as to when and how to make these additional payments. I simply hear that by making additional payments, this can interfere with my direct debit. I feel as a graduate student who has the ability to pay above my monthly payment and is wanting to, that this service should be more accurate with their responses and more helpful. I have asked multiple times if I wanted to make additional payments ( outside of my direct debit ) when should I do this during the month. I have yet to receive the same answer twice from them. I have been told multiple times that this will effect my direct debit which I do not want to mess up. \\nI have also called regarding setting up direct debit and was told that once I apply for direct debit, I must then e-mail if I want my funds dispersed a specific way. I sent my e-mail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX about how how I would like my funds dispersed and finally received a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that this could be done and would apply to my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment due date. I checked my account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX only to find it stating I was \\\" delinquent. '' I called and the FedLoan Servicing representative stated that I was delinquent due to my payment being due on a Sunday and the payments do n't take place on weekends - I 'm not sure why I would be delinquent because of this. I also noted that my payment was not disbursed correctly, but did note the e-mail I received stated it may take a few days. It is now XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and my payment still has yet to be disbursed properly. In the meantime, I have yet to receive an answer as to how to make an additional payment without it interfering with my direct debit. \\nToday, I called XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to see why my payment has not been dispersed properly, went through my exact e-mail that was sent with the representative who stated the money was disbursed improperly due to how it the e-mail instructions were processed ; I am happy to share my e-mail with how clear my instructions were. As of now, I am on hold, waiting for the representative and my call is at 50 minutes and the problem has yet to be resolved ; I should be reimbursed for my time. \\nI feel it is very unfortunate that the USA is public about how high student debt is in our country, but does not discuss how difficult it is to make a payment. I am a highly educated student with a professional position and would like to work toward eliminating this debt as soon as possible and I would appreciate it if FedLoan Servicing would be able to answer my questions with trustworthy answers that do not fluctuate with the person answering. I also feel that a Federal servicing place like this one, should have an office staffed with employees capable of helping students. After all, many students who have just graduated from college have many other new adaptations to make and paying their student loans off should not be so difficult. \\nI find it interesting how the company is so helpful for those who ca n't pay their student loans as the company makes more money on interest. The company needs to learn how to work with people who are able and willing to pay ahead. The time I have spent trying to organize direct debit, explain how I would like my funds disbursed, and trying to get an answer on how to make additional payments has been ridiculous.

Once the bill was finally settled with my insurance, I upped that amount to {$20.00} monthly as that is all I can afford, especially with all the other medical payments I 'm making around this issue, hospital,  XXXX , etc. I was surprised and infuriated when I was put into COLLECTION despite making regular payments ( I have documentation from my bank, which I shared with them ).

I asked for documentation to be submitted to me in writing, was put on hold and disconnected. I waited as I had given her my contact information in case of such an event, yet no call came. I called back, and the next person I spoke to told me an entirely different story.

So, I paid XXXX XXXX XXXX directly, a copy of that payment is included in this complaint.

They have may XXXX errors with my mortgage this year so far. # 1 On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I received a check for {$1000.00} from \\\" Loan Care '' stating that my Escrow had an overage & that this amount was being return to me. I call \\\" Loan Care '' { same day } asking that this call be recorded as well. Then I ask the CSR was this check send out an error on \\\" Loan Care '' part or was this for real and to check to be sure this was not a mistake. The CS person said that the check was not a mistake, it was an overage to my Loan & Escrow accounts, that all bills { loans & Insurance and taxes } are paid. I question the CSR again & the same answer. The CSR person said that if I did n't want the check, just send it back. I reply that if is this for real, I was going to pay a bill with it. # 2. I found out on XXXX that \\\" Loan Care '' had been applying Mortgage payments to my Escrow account. # 3. I call \\\" Loan Care '' on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to find out were my Loan Statement was, I 'm trying to Re-fi my mortgage with XXXX & need a up to date statement. That 's went I was told ; that I was behind in Home payments & it had been reported to the \\\" Credit Company 's ''. That 's when I found out that my Mortgage payments were being added to Escrow accounts. After talking to XXXX different CS 's, I found out that they had added XXXX Mortgage payments to my Escrow account & not my Mortgage. \\\" Loan Care '' Mortgage Company only found these errors out when I call them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

After multiple attempts of doing this, the representative told me that her system was down and that I could call the department directly. \\n\\nI then called the Fraud department and spoke with a total of ( 3 ) representatives one of which was a supervisor for approximately 2 hours and 6 minutes to no avail. Finally, when the last department I was forwarded to, actually told me that they could n't give me any information as to why their department was handling my account ( spoke to XXXX in the Card Review Department ), she did tell me that for whatever reason both of my credit card accounts were now under review for \\\" credit risk '' reasons. I asked her what that meant and what it entailed, and she told me that her department goes in to my credit report, matches whatever information, and then decided essentially if I am credit worthy to continue to use my accounts. Now, you have to factor in my pay history on these accounts and the fact that XXXX of them my credit line was increased from {$1000.00} - {$2500.00} for \\\" credit worthiness ''. I also received an additional card just last month obviously based on credit worthiness. \\n\\nEven though what I have stated so far is concerning and that at any time without even telling me Chase can shut my cards down. This bigger concerns are what I was told from XXXX, the representative from this department : 1 - I can not make payments or do anything regarding this account until the review is completed which will take up to 10 calendar days. This is concerning because I have a payment due tomorrow, I have never been late on any payments, quite the contrary my pay history is impeccable. Also, because it is now frozen and I ca n't pay my balance, it will now be reported as over the balance and will absolutely destroy my credit. \\n\\n2- Chase can not prevent me from paying my credit card and then in turn report information accordingly to the credit bureau 's. That is simply illegal. I conveyed to XXXX that I was wanting to dispute a charge of $ XXXX that was recently applied to my account from XXXX . I told her that it was not authorized by me and that at the very least would they allow me to dispute that charge? She said unfortunately they can not. \\n\\n3- I asked XXXX if there is any documentation I can send her, or that I could go in to any branch and supply whatever documentation chase might need in order to alleviate whatever concerns they might have. She said unfortunately it was not an identity issue but rather a credit worthiness issue. I then explained to XXXX that Chase can not prevent me from even making a payment and then in turn reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. She essentially did n't care and certainly did not understand my concern. \\n\\n4- I personally do n't care how long Chase wants to review my accounts. At this point, because of the horrendous and in fact illegal customer service protocol, I do n't even care if these accounts stay open. What I do care about is Chase not reporting to the credit bureaus until their review is completed and I have been given an opportunity to make a payment on my accounts, especially the Amazon card which is to have a statement cutoff of XXXX XXXX. My previous pay history will tell you that I make multiple payments a month and keep my utilization very low before it is reported to the bureaus. I do this to maximize my credit worthiness, see the irony here, and because I only charge what I can essentially pay off in cash at any time. \\n\\nThis needs to be rectified immediately. Someone needs to do their job, have the professionalism and ethics required by the FCRA and call me so that we can work together to alleviate whatever this is.

In the dispute, it is clearly stated several times that the dispute was not a refusal to pay but a request for verification of the alleged debt. I have a very detailed copy of the commercial affidavits sent to the debt collector under notary presentment by permission from XXXX XXXX and I also retain copies of the response from the debt collectors. \\nThis dispute was sent to one debt collector who then handed it off, or sold it, to another debt collector when they could not provide the requested validations in our dispute. The second debt collection firm is an alleged attorney firm. \\nAfter receiving the request for validations, the second debt collector returned a stack of copied statements as verification without any affidavits swearing to the authenticity of records to which I responded with a notice explaining the debt collector 's response was insufficient to verify the debt. Furthermore, the debt collector has not provided any of the requested validations or records to prove it is the holder in due course of any alleged obligation. No copies of contracts, no clarification of the facts requested to be proven by the debt collector and most certainly, no affidavits attesting to the veracity of the debt collector 's allegations were ever sent to me or the beneficiary. \\nThe debt collector was given 30 days to provide its proofs and requested validations. After 30 days had lapsed, another notice was sent under notary presentment attesting that we had received no valid responses and that the debt collector is in default of its obligation to provide such disclosure as to prove its alleged ownership and/or rights to the alleged debt. The account has also been charged off by the alleged creditor which to our knowledge, is not assignable as a \\\" debt '' for an account does not constitute a debt under the commercial law. \\nAfter two equitable attempts to have the debt collector provide requested validations for proof of debt with no avail, this debt collector filed a lawsuit against the beneficiary as if the equitable claim has no standing, force or affect in law. To our understanding, our records are under Notary seal and are the only true records at issue since the debt collector has not provided any at all. These records can be sent for authentication by the Secretary of State where the notary resides if need be. \\nHere we have a first third party debt collector then a second third party debt collector that has not provided a bona fide contract and/or affidavits to attest that the debt collector as a valid party to the missing contract nor has not proven itself a rightful holder to any security or provided any authentic records from its alleged principal when requested clearly showing an attempt to defraud the beneficiary of money, which then turned into the collection agent, as attorney, claiming to represent the principal with no evidence, proof or affidavits from the principal to substantiate any of its claims. \\nWe feel the beneficiary is being taken advantage of by the attorney firm first acting as debt collector without any valid proof of claim then using their weight as attorneys to act as council for the alleged principal without any evidence of substance in an attempt to subvert the rights the beneficiary has under the law.\",\"i am behind on my car payment but I have an automatic withdrawal set up to come out of account this month. they keep calling me every couple minutes sometimes XXXX in a minute.

At the point I told \\\" XXXX '' that I called the company and I asked for him and he never existed, so I told him that I did n't wanted the internship anymore and that I would return his money. I also told him that I would not retrieve the money in cash ( like I did with the first check ), but that I would do a wire transfer, so I did it through my Bank of America using XXXX. I sent him the confirmation number of the transfer and that was it, I never spoke to him again.\",\"The first incident started on XX/XX/XXXX when {$840.00} was removed from my escrow account for the payment of homeowners insurance, however on XX/XX/XXXX {$930.00} was also removed for the payment of homeowners insurance. Obviously 2 payments were not necessary, it took approximately 1 month for Citimortgage to correct the problem and return the additional funds that were removed. All the while leaving my escrow account with less funds than it was supposed to have. The second incident occurred onXX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, when PMI in the amount of {$170.00} was erroneously removed from my escrow account. They had already removed the {$170.00} for PMI on XX/XX/XXXX which fulfilled the amount needed for the month of XXXX. I filed a \\\" complaint '' regarding the extra funds being removed and have yet to have the money returned or given an explanation as to why after 13 years of having PMI, it was taken out more than once this month. I have grown tired of having \\\" shortages '' in my escrow account due to the continued mishandling of my account. I urge you to look further into the errors being made by Citimortgage.\",\"This credit card account WAS not opened in XXXX is was opened in XXXX and the last payment and the made in XXXX. This company has brought the debt and it starting the time all over. Which is not to be done. Per Federal law requires that collection agencies report the original delinquency date from the original account. Because the original delinquency date does not change, the seven year time frame does not start over when an account is sold or transferred to a another lender or collection agency.\",\"Update to complaint number XXXX appears to be a duplicate of a complaint we already have on file for you under number XXXX. \\nI filed complaints regarding Wells Fargo Surepay service. In the latest letter from Wells, again refusing to refund my funds to me, they included their account disclosures. Under Section 14 \\\" Responsibility for Errors '' there is a clause that indicates they will make 'all reasonable efforts to reverse or delete such instructions '. It goes on to say that the user accepts all responsibility for losses resulting from those errors. \\nI do n't think that Wells has acted in good faith in abiding by this section : 1 ) they told me where the money was and gave me the tracking number and the routing number and name of the institution where the money went-so they know where the funds went. Giving me this information does not sound like a good faith effort on their part to 'reverse or delete such instructions ' ; 2 ) I called and asked Wells Fargo to simply reverse the wire transfer and obtain my funds back. They indicated they could not do that. \\nWell, their disclosures indicate 'good faith effort ' but their real actions on this were similar to throwing their hands up in the air and doing nothing on my behalf. \\nSection XXXX B indicates that payments are not final for 60 days and the member may seek to recover funds during those 60 days. While this applies to payments received by members, it certainly indicates : 1 ) there is a process for recovering payments and 2 ) payments made within 60 days are definitely open to being recovered. I notified Wells within 5 days of the error and have received nothing from them except indications that they can not, or will not, do anything to correct this error.\",\"I disputed this debt and on XXXX the agency removed it from my credit report. This company runs under many different names. I would get letter stating again, that I owe the debt. I would write back as required within 30 days stating I do not owe the debt, and requested proof that I owe it. I never received the proof, because I do not owe it. I sent the last letter out to their address and the letter was sent back to me, the letter was requesting proof that I owed the debt. Now, again, on XX/XX/XXXX, they are once again reporting it on my credit report. Mind you that this debt is from more than 5 years ago. They are reporting it as new, when it is not. In the state of Nebraska the statute states that the statute of limitation is 4 yeas, and mine falls under that category. I have explained to them I do not owe the debt, and the debt I had, I paid to the original creditor. Also, that I never lived at the address one of the services were provided. I am tired of this company reporting to my credit, and sending me letter from their sub companies in order to obtain money I do not owe. I have once again disputed with XXXX, and have decided to file this complaint. They have shady tactics to obtain money from a debt account they purchased. Originally it was with SW Credit Systems, I disputed it with them as well, then they \\\" sold '' my account to XXXX XXXX, Or XXXX, and its subcompanies. I need them to stop and not to \\\" sell '' this account to someone else so I can go through the same thing all over again.\",\"In 2007 XXXX XXXX XXXX offered me a {$150000.00} loan in my house I did not accept this offer nor did I sign it.\",\"I received an email offer from Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2015 offering a {$300.00} bonus for signing up for a checking account and having $ XXXX of payroll direct deposit within 3 months. I met those requirements and never received the bonus. It has now been over 6 months and still no bonus. I have called Bank of America customer service at least 10 times. I 've talked to multiple supervisors who have to check with their promo dept to look into the matter and to the best of my knowledge they are having trouble finding me in their database of customers who received this offer. This has been going on for 6-8 weeks. No one seems to really want to address my issue. I 've offered to forward the email and provide any other info to prove to them that I received the offer email from them but instead they give me another date and put me off for 2 more weeks while they escalate my issue. I have done everything I can think of to solve this on my own but have run out of options. At one point someone at BofA suggested I go to a local branch and have them fax a copy of the printed email I received which I was willing to do except for there are no branches within XXXX miles of where I live. \\nThis is fraud. They 've offered me something, I meet all the requirements, and then BofA requires me to spend 25+ hours of my time on the phone with them fighting for the bonus.\",\"Addendum to Case # XXXX ... .This is in regards to an account with a credit union. The direct deposit from the VA was not properly routed ( See attached ). Deposits had to be made in cash, at a local credit union branch. On XX/XX/XXXX, payments were processed via bill pay, before the deposits posted. Some payments cleared, while others were returned, some payments were returned multiple times. This in turn caused over XXXX dollars in bank fees. Unbeknownst to me at that time, some utility payments, as well as credit cards payments were returned by the bill payment provider. These payments were coded to appear as if it was myself who refused these payments, therefore causing 30 day late to appear on my credit files. Also, I have had a utility terminated due to this, as well as another utility suspended. I contacted my former credit union, to receive a contact number for this bill payment service. Upon contacting this company, the call suddenly terminates without my speaking to anyone in regards to this matter. I had a bill payment service approve payments while there are insufficient funds in one 's account. I have also attached proof some payments were attempted more than twice. According to credit card companies, when a payment is returned, that payment is applied to the balance, unless otherwise instructed. I did not interfere with the processing of the credit card payment. I was informed by the credit card company, a notation was placed on the payment, therefore causing the card to become late on my credit files. Furthermore, this company has not mailed me at my mailing address, in regards to this matter. I have provided notes from a conversation with XXXX XXXX, in regards to what was to happen if a payment is returned. Also, I have included verification of the Direct Deposit that was intended for my credit union for XX/XX/XXXX. Also, the address the credit union, as well as the USPS, and the Department of Veteran Affairs, as of XX/XX/XXXX. Also, I only received notification of this alleged debt after receiving a phone call from this company, on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a letter be mailed to me in regards to this matter. I never received such letter. As I was contacted less than 21 days after the payment was allegedly made, there was no attempt to resolve this matter within the credit union. I was not allocated the full thirty calendar days to dispute this alleged debt. as it has been now over sixty calendar days, and I still have not received formal notice by postal mail, this alleged debt is hereby invalid. As you mentioned in your previous answer to the CFPB, my address was considered as \\\" invalid '', according to your company. As an alleged collector of debts, my address could have been obtained by contacting the credit union itself or by conducting \\\" skip tracing '' with the credit bureaus. Also, I find it rather perplexing how you had an invalid address when you contacted me via telephone. I also informed you of the correct mailing address per our telephone conversation on XX/XX/XXXX.\",\"I spoke with a representative at XXXX because person by the name of XXXX called my XXXX year old mother and asked if I live there. My mother, who has XXXX, said yes and he gave her his information to call him. He called XX/XX/XXXX to tell my mother I had an outstanding debt of {$110.00}. When I got home one night at the beginning of the month she stated that she gave someone her credit card to pay this debt. I did not put two and two together till this morning. When I contacted them at XXXX and requested XXXX , a young lady answered the phone and when I explained the situation and she could not help me I asked for a supervisor. It was at this time I realized what was happening. This supervisor by the name of XXXX, XXXX??? I 'm sorry I ca n't remember ... maybe XXXX or XXXX ... she told me that she spoke with me, on XXXX XXXX, and I told her that she should call my mother, I apparently gave this debt collector my XXXX year old mother 's name and she would pay the bill. It was then I realzed my mother gave them her credit card number to pay them XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I never, ever spoke to this women and I believe they lied to her, scammed her and here we are today. I can pull my phone records to prove I never spoke to this supervisor. I can also tell you the young lady I spoke was XXXX and the other rep was XXXX and I know XXXX knows the supervsors name. The reason the debt was never paid on XX/XX/2016 is because my mom must have transposed a number because the pmt did not got through.

In 2015 I have been assessed Fees of {$140.00} and Interest of {$100.00} just in 2015 alone. I called US Bank and was quickly transferred to a representative and explained my financial hardship and was told fees and interest could not be reversed. I feel I have paid thousands of dollars to US Bank in Overdraft, Fees and Interest over the last twenty years that the US Bank representative should have negotiated a pay down balance to {$400.00} and I would pay off the balance over the course of a year.

The first few times I was quickly suggested into 'deferment, ' and told I would receive paperwork for an income-based repayment plan, which was never received. Each call resulted in the same discussion ... my payments were based on my GROSS income, not factoring in any cost of living expenses. The payments were unaffordable. I even remarked at how they would rather receive nothing from me instead of making accommodations that at least allow me to pay SOMETHING monthly. Out of sheer frustration I just quit dealing with the customer service, as I was told something different every time I called, with no flexibility whatsoever when it came to payment plans. I finally worked with someone at a financial institution who called on my behalf, and was then told my only option for lowering payments was consolidation. At this point, my accumulated interest has nearly doubled my loans, and consolidation is difficult due to the hit this has taken on my credit score. I am working with a financial institution to hopefully consolidate and obtain a payment plan that I can afford while still affording the cost of basic living. I am beyond frustrated and stressed at how these loans have affected my financial health and ability to maintain a decent credit score. When I call Navient now, I am in default and have to make an exorbitant payment to catch up, which also is not feasible. The inflexibility of this company and customer service is beyond reprehensible, especially given the impact these loans have on someone 's credit score, financial state, and overall life affordability. It is n't that I do not want to pay, I WANT TO PAY ... but simply can not at the price they suggest I can. I have made it more than clear to Navient my willingness to pay, and they have made it frustrating and difficult .... actually impossible, to do so. I am nervous they will cause difficulties with my consolidation due to the status of my loans, which would create an even worse situation for me financially, as consolidation actually provides an affordable payment option for me.\",\"I am the victim of identity theft and I have placed a 90 day initial security alert on my credit reporting agency accounts.

I was told by the counselor, the dean and multiple people at the college that my credits earned and my Associate education would be accredited and transferable to any major college. I went through the 2 year program and graduated with honors as a network administrator. Unfortunately my lack of real education did not provide me the skills or knowledge to get a job in my studied field. I decided in order to continue in the field I would need to get a degree from a traditional college. However when I looked into enrollment I was informed that XXXX was not accredited and therefore none of my credits would be transferable. Basically making my education irrelevant. This coupled with the fact that I had no more skills to enter the technology field than before I graduated and indebted myself to over {$20000.00} in student loans. Force me to work remedial jobs and defer my student loan. Over the years I have made arrangements to repay the loan to the best of my ability. However to date I have repaid over {$10000.00} and still owe more than what I originally borrowed. I believe the most current demand from Nelnet is for over {$22000.00}. So my complaint is one the student loan was made based on lies and misleading individuals within the XXXX school. I understand that Nelnet did n't lie about that but the loan should have not been provided based on the knowledge that the school I was attending was in essence a fraud. The school has since been shut down from my understanding for exactly the reasons I described. In addition Nelnet is charging me a higher interest rate than the current mortgage industry and with penalties and whatever else they charge there is no way I can ever get out from under the loan. From XXXX I paid faithfully over {$200.00} a month and never saw my principle balance decrease at all. I now have XXXX children and a XXXX on the way. I need this loan to be reconsidered and either adjusted to account for the payments I have made or forgiven altogether. This school was a complete scam and Nelnet is culpable for letting kids take out loans for something that will never benefit them in there ability to earn the income necessary to repay the loan. The only relief Nelnet offers is to make small interest payments. Again never providing true relief. What good is it for me to take food off the table and pay {$200.00} a month to watch my loan go up. Now that I have stopped paying I am getting phones 2-3 per day from Nelnet or random companies that either are calling on behalf of Nelnet or somehow know I am in default and are trying to get my loan current one particular company that calls me at least 10 times a week from all kinds of different numbers is XXXX. In addition I have received threating emails that they will garnish my wages and take my tax returns as a result of my default. I can not afford for either to happen.

We read too many things about homeowners being told to make trial payments so the modifications would go through, then the modifications took way longer than the 3 months and in the end they were denied anyway and given a huge bill as the trial amount was never accepted as your payments. We told them no thanks and did not sign anything and kept going on making our payments.\\nAbout 7 months later we get a letter in the mail saying our trial modification was denied and we needed to make a lump payment sum of roughly 10k or they would start foreclosure procedures. We got multiple phone calls daily from them telling us that they were collecting a debt and if we did n't pay the amount they would foreclose. We kept explaining to them we had never missed a payment and we did n't owe them any late payments. It took us over a week and a half of us calling them constantly, we finally told them to send us they paperwork where it showed anything that we signed to be put in a trial modification program. Ever day we got their robo-dialer calls saying they were collecting a debt and we were behind. They realized they had no such form and finally agreed to look into it. It took them a few weeks more before they finally came back that we never agreed to the trial plan.\\nA few months later we get bill saying we never paid our ins/taxes. Per them we had to come up with over 6k or our mortgage was going to go up XXXX a month because we were behind. Again we had to take weeks to explain to them we were not behind and it took them over a month to figure out they had us listed for a trial modification plan that we were never in. They actually took so long, \\\" their '' new amount actually went in to effect.\\nNow a year later we get told that our equity mortgage payment is going up on XXXX/XXXX/2017 and that we need to make our new payment. They have sent us nothing with a new amount so we called yesterday and we were told that there is nothing in their system that shows our payment is increasing and it 's the same it has been.\\nTheir website shows upcoming payments changes for XXXX/XXXX/2017 and nothing is changing. I had the wife call again today with the letter in hand because every step of the way Ocwen has been nothing but shady and dishonest. So today we get told they ca n't give us an exact amount but it looks like the payment is going up over 800 a month on XX/XX/XXXX.\\nWe notified Ocwen of all the above and they told us a Ombudsmen would be in contact with us.\\nSince Ocwen was notified of our latest issue just under a month ago the following has occurred : *My next due payment (XX/XX/XXXX ) has all the sudden gone up an additional {$890.00} with not a single letter or phone call saying why or where this number comes from. But on the upcoming payment changes part of their website this number is no where to be found just our current payment amount ( showing due XX/XX/XXXX ).\\n*We have for the past 3 weeks received a phone call from their ombudsmen saying they were looking into our issues ( they will not tell us what they are looking into, just that they are looking into them and need more time ).\\n*When asked about the payment increase they know nothing on where the amount came from or why it is the amount it is. Just told that they need more time.\\n*I pointed out that the amount is wrong and asked them to at least put that amount on hold and let us pay the normal amount until they get us an answer on why the amount has gone up by so much. I was told they ca n't do that. I have had multiple times where the payments have been wrong on Ocwen 's part that I have had to pay that they later went back and changed to the correct amount.\\nSo with 3 weeks to go till this \\\" new '' payment no one is telling me anything other than they need more time. So now I am suppose to suffer because Ocwen does n't have their stuff together? Again I 100 % think Ocwen 's goal is to have us foreclose on my home.\\nHow can a company continue to make mistake after mistake and I pay for it? They can raise a payment by almost {$900.00} and never give you any notification on why or where this comes from?\",\"THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT!!

Each week a representative from the company would call making additional and repetitive requests for the same information implaying that the loan was in the approval stage to string us along to the point that we could not go through another company to seek a lone because Quicken ; s multiple inquiries precluded us by dragging down our credit score. Unfortunately, Quicken failed in their promise to complete the loan. \\nTwo weeks ago my wife made an inquirery with Quicken again to secure a VA mortage loan. Again we provided all the information. The representative stated that the loan was in the approval phase. Today the representative stated that he needed me to file my XX/XX/XXXX taxes which are not due until XX/XX/XXXX. I informed the representive that I may have to request for a tax extension because I have business deductions. He stated that although he has my XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX, Quicken needs my XX/XX/XXXX taxes to be filed before the loan can be approved. I think that I have been mis led by deceptive loan practices and I feel betraied by the mis representation by Quicken and their loan agents and practices. Quicken could have informed be prior to me signing th papers for my credit information that I could not have income tax which showed adjusted income on my tax information.

I could not seem to get anyone to talk to me about refinancing. To make a long story short my loan was never reaffirmed. I had no idea what that meant until now and I do not know how that happened.

In other words it is like i do not even own my house. The attorney said they could not do that so now I am find out that apparently they can. My complaint is this. I was not told by anyone about this. They reaffirmed my car but nothing was said about the house. Now the mortgage company says it is my attorneys fault and my attorney says it is thiers.

Due to the fact that the property was new construction, the initial taxes due were low due to them being on a low assessed value of an unimproved lot worth {$11000.00}. The property then became assessed at a value of {$180000.00}. However taxes due on this new value for the City of XXXX did n't start until XXXX of XXXX and wo n't become due for the XXXX County until XXXX of XXXX. \\n\\nRegardless I was instructed to put money down into escrow at loan closing despite my protest. I also paid {$770.00} a month into escrow to cover taxes, mortgage insurance, and hazard insurance. It was my belief that this would be the correct eventual amount. \\n\\nI called Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation in XXXX of XXXX to request a refund for loan number XXXX. They stalled, saying they did not have all the taxes. In informed them they should get a City tax bill shortly. Once they received it they did perform an analysis in XXXX and I did receive a refund of {$6500.00}. However they increased my monthly escrow payment to {$860.00}. \\n\\nI have now complained that they have the incorrect tax information for over a month. You see what they did was list my City of XXXX taxes at XXXX x {$1400.00} or {$5700.00}. The taxes are paid quarterly but only the first payment is {$1400.00}, the following XXXX are {$1000.00} for a total yearly of {$4500.00}. So they overestimated by {$1100.00} or {$97.00} a month. \\n\\nThey still have not fixed the error. They asked me to provide a bill, but I 'm not provided a copy by the City of XXXX until paid in full. I told them the information was available online at XXXX or they could call and request the information. \\n\\nIn addition, whoever has been looking at my account has now altered my hazard insurance from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX Co with a wrong policy number and amount of {$550.00}. I did call the Hazard Insurance department at Roundpoint and verified they still have XXXX XXXX listed, but my online escrow account page still has the incorrect information. \\n\\nIn addition the XXXX is now listed wrong as well at {$1500.00} instead of {$1600.00} even though they pay that insurance monthly for {$130.00} which annualized is {$1600.00}. \\n\\nI believe the evidence shows that somebody incompetent is reviewing my account or doing my escrow analysis. \\n\\nListed below are the correct annual amounts. XXXX XXXX has not billed but appears to be correct in relationship to what my neighbors are paying and is the estimated figure provided by Roundpoint. \\n\\nMy Escrow Analysis XXXX County Taxes : {$2400.00} City of XXXX Taxes : {$4500.00} Mortgage Insurance : {$1600.00} Hazard Insurance : {$550.00}. \\n\\nTotal Yearly Costs : {$9100.00} / XXXX = Monthly Escrow {$760.00} I am request that my escrow be updated to {$760.00} a month. \\n\\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\",\"discover bank closed my credit card 5-6 months ago, I just submitted an application today but got rejected because Discover bank said I had a closed card with discover ( discover closed my account without any explanation ).

I never received this card, and there is a {$5000.00} line of credit associated with the account. I can see it in my on-line account. This was done around the time that my home mortgage was being processed which is also owned by Wells Fargo. Looking back, it appears Wells Fargo issued me an unauthorized line of credit, adjusting my debt to credit ratio. This affected my credit score, which affects the APR I pay to the Wells Fargo mortgage. As a result I am now paying additional interest to Wells Fargo, through my mortgage at a cost of thousands of dollars over my 30 year mortgage. Also, this affects any other loan amounts I finance because of the unauthorized adjustment they made to my credit score, such as vehicles, appliances and home improvements. I have worked very hard to manage my credit score, and that they fraudulently adjusted it is very very frustrating. \\nAdditionally, around this same time, they cancelled a savings account I had with them since 1992 which was in excess of several XXXX dollars.

They suggested that I open a new account with a new account number and that would solve the problem. They filed a claim for me to get the a refund on all the money that I lost due non authorization debits on my account. I thought my troubles were taken care off. I noticed that on the new account, it was still being debited!!! Wow!! I called them and was told that by a supervisor that she had made the necessary changes and would re-file my claim and it should not happen.  Guess  what? Not only did they deny my claim but it was still happening. I was just frustrated with them so I called them to close my account again. They would not let me close it. Now because it has been negative due to them accommodating debits on a new account, with a new account number they finally closed it. I want to resolve this issue because I do n't owe them anything and I do n't want this on my credit report when I did everything that I was suppose to and they did n't.

American express promptly credited me with XXXX Membership Reward points to my account ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ). \\n\\nRecently ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) they took back the XXXX points in my account saying that I committed fraud to get the points and they were taking them back. At no time did I commit fraud, the only event that happened since earning the points was that I downgraded the Platinum Card to an Everyday American Express card. The reason I did this is that I discovered I would not be accepting a new job where the travel benefits of the Platinum card would be beneficial to me. At the time of cancelling the Platinum Card, I explicitly asked the American Express rep in our chat if I would lose the points by cancelling. The rep for AMEX said that I would keep all the points since I am maintaining the AMEX everyday card. This was a chat conversation that I know AMEX has the records to look up the exact conversation with details. Clearly I was lied to by this AMEX rep and would have kept the card open if the rep told me by cancelling I would lose the points. Which they did not! \\n\\nUpon having the points clawed back I contacted AMEX on why this happened and if they could fix it. AMEX would only respond that it was fraud with no specifics or evidence and they could not do anything to get my Membership Rewards points. I am a 20 years customer of AMEX and not some alleged Grifter. I feel that AMEX has committed their own fraud by not fulfilling their obligation of my XXXX Membership Rewards points offer. Furthermore, even when clarifying the situation before cancelling the Platinum Card, they lied again by telling me that I would keep my points by downgrading to the AMEX Everyday card. \\n\\nAMEX should honor their offer and reinstate my XXXX points as they are the only party committed fraud here by not honoring their own offer obligations.\",\"A company placed a collections at the XXXX credit bureaus, and has not sent me any proof the debt is mine.

I have only been met with insults, placed on hold for extended and unreasonable periods of time, yelled at, treated as though I was subhuman, and completely neglected. Being unable to resolve this matter, despite the many calls I have placed to this company, has negatively impacted my life and finances. I have had to pay more for deposits at other complexes, my credit score has this blemish, I have been turned away from a local program that would aid me in obtaining a grant for the purchase of a home, and had to pay higher interest rates.

The sales representative was given the measurements of the space where the sectional would reside, and the sales rep determined that the ottoman would fit in with the sectional. As it turned the sectional was far too narrow to have the ottoman fit between both sides of the sectional. I tried to work with the furniture store, who it turns out is a highly unethical merchant. I spent a great deal of time with the credit card company, whose initial representative advised me he was sure they would not charge me for this ottoman ( which was way overpriced compared to other stores ). I followed the credit card company 's demand for information, but they also required me to get a statement from a similar merchant that basically supports my contention. I told them I have NEVER HEARD of any merchant requiring such a thing. What merchant is going to stop his business long enough to not only talk to me about the issue, but also prepare a document stating that he/she supports my contention. This is utterly ridiculous. I asked the credit card company to please give me the name of one merchant in my area who would make such an evaluation with no benefit to themselves, and they could not. I asked the credit card company to request the measurements from the store, and they refused. It is clear the credit card company does not want to honor its claims of supporting customers who have been cheated my merchants. The credit card company is requiring a completely disinterested third party merchant to get involved in the dispute and write a document supporting my contention. In other words, this is the credit card company 's way of dismissing the dispute and leaving the cardholder hanging with an unfair and unjust charge.\",\"My mortgage was sold to Specialized Loan Servicing on XX/XX/2016.

Again, my Well Fargo credit card was declined. I did n't understand that, so on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I went to my files and pulled my bank statements and discovered that Wells Fargo did not send me a credit card statement in XXXX 2016 ( When statements come in from all sources -- banks and utilities, I put them in a little box, in a pile ). Wells Fargo not only failed to send me a statement in XXXX 2016, the bank deactivated my credit card, and sent a negative entry to the credit bureaus, without notifying me. I have been utilizing credit off and on for 45 years, and this sort of thing has never happened to me. It is the most recent statement, XXXX 2016, that shows derogatory information in my account. Wells Fargo knows that I have excellent credit and, therefore, they should have notified me if they believed that I did not make a payment. The truth is, I did not know until recently, when I checked my bank files, that Wells Fargo had not sent me a statement in XXXX 2016 ( I am in the process of designing a spreadsheet that will show the names of all creditors ( banks and utilities ) and the dates on which their statements arrive ).\",\"States Recovery Systems Inc added XXXX accounts to my credit file, via XXXX, after lots of back and fourth and disputing the XXXX collection accounts with XXXX they have not removed these accounts.

So now I do n't want to pay them, I just want them removed from my credit file.

I have not missed ANY payments since that modification. I am now being told my loan is in default for payments not received from BEFORE the modification agreement began. They are also now refusing to accept any more payments from me, unless I pay back from 7 months PRIOR to the modification agreement.  <P/> Required Trial payments, which were a prerequisite of the modification were done  XX/XX/XXXX  XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX . It appears  US Bank  then typed their paperwork effective  XX/XX/XXXX , with payments being due  XX/XX/XXXX . However, the original modification was not received until  XX/XX/XXXX . It has numerous errors of which we filed a dispute. Some of the errors were corrected & the newly Corrected Modification packet was not received by me until  XX/XX/XXXX .  <P/> The modification agreement was not received by me until  XX/XX/XXXX . This can be verified by page  1  of the modification wherein it states  ( Executed  on this day :  XX/XX/XXXX  ).  Page 1 of t he modification agreement also states \\\" Cash amount required '' \\\"  1st  Modification Payment of {$810.00} '' is due within 14 days of receipt of the modification. This further validates that payments were expected to begin in  XX/XX/XXXX  & not  XX/XX/XXXX .  <P/> Why am I being held responsible for payments PRIOR to the modification agreement? Especially since the modification states that payment amounts and due dates would be modified after I sign and return a copy of the agreement to  US B ank. To require a person to began a modification in default defies the purpose of a modification and has to be illegal. When you accepted my initial payment with the modification in  XX/XX/XXXX , I would have already been 8 months behind if your XX/XX/XXXX  due date was correctly written. You also did n't notify me of this  XX/XX/XXXX  date until  XX/XX/XXXX   <P/> I spoke with  US B ank employee  XXXX   XXXX  on  XX/XX/XXXX  at @  XXXX  CT, who confirmed this mistake and said the modification payment  1st d ue date should NOT have been for  XX/XX/XXXX  as you all did not execute the agreement until  XX/XX/XXXX .

These chargers stem from a mistake made by one of XXXX other subcontractors, a company called XXXX XXXX, a long time ago. I have contested these charges over the phone ; by certified mail ; and even in person ( at their XXXX campus membership services office ). XXXX -- as well as their collection company Evergreen Professional Recoveries -- has never once replied to my written contestations of these charges, and calling them on the phone accomplishes nothing. \\n\\nI am contacting the CFPB because it seems that this an unjustifiable -- and likely illegal -- shakedown by XXXX and their subcontractors. Even knowing that they have no cause to bill me, it is clear that once a charge is in their system, they ignore their own written billing policies about the contestation process, and just keep billing and threatening someones credit rating until the customer just gives up and sends them the money -- even if that money is clearly not owed to them. I have tried well over a dozen times to work this out with them, but each time I get the same endless runaround. It is now clear that this is not a mistake by a single individual at XXXX, so it must be XXXX & Evergreen Professional Recoveries company policy to ignore their own mistakes, and shakedown consumers for money, even if they realize later they are not owed it. \\n\\nMy personal experience is that each time I respond to their phone calls, and contest the {$140.00} over the phone, I get an \\\" oops '' from them, and they do stop harassing me for a few months, but it never lasts. A few months later it just starts up again from square one. I have spent so many hours and hours on the phone -- with both XXXX and their collection company Evergreen Professional -- dealing with this same {$140.00} fee over the last two years, that it feels like a part time job. Each time I call I am told the erroneous charges will be investigated, and that I would receive a written response soon. They never send me anything, and each time I call back they tell me they have no record of my previous calls and letters. \\n\\nI even drove an hour round trip into XXXX, and went into membership services office in person on XX/XX/XXXX, after failing to get any response on the phone or through the mail. The membership service representative told me that it looked to him like one of XXXX 's subcontractor ( XXXX XXXX ) had made a billing mistake a while back, but by the time XXXX XXXX noticed it ( nearly a year later ) it was too late to bill the Auto insurance carrier as they should have done ( I was hit by a drunk driver ). He then told me that it looked to him like those charges should never have been put on my account. The poor fellow spend over half an hour on the phone, while I sat in his office, watching him fax documents to his own billing department to try and get this taken care of. It was so ridiculous that I took a picture of him working ( which I still have ). In the end he was obviously incredibly frustrated with his own billing department, and told me that even he could n't get confirmation that it was taken care of for certain, but that hopefully it now would be. Several months later the harassment started up again, and once again they claimed they had no record of their own employee 's interdepartmental faxes and phone call. \\n\\nAgain, this shakedown seems to be either company policy ; or it is a company wide level of negligence that -- since XXXX benefits from it financially -- they have no interest in fixing.\",\"Focus Receivable Debt Collection Agency is constantly calling with a recorded message.

As part of the settlement agreement, the check had restrictive endorsement upon receiving payment the XXXX account should have been removed from my reports. Restrictive endorsements are legally binding contracts in the state of Texas where the check was cashed as well as the state of Georgia where I reside. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent copies of the settled check to each of the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) requesting the account be removed. On X/X/2017, upon reviewing my reports, I noticed that the account was still there. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX department and the customer service representative said she could not locate me in their system and to contact XXXX XXXX. I explained to the representative the situation and told her that XXXX XXXX is not reporting on my credit report but XXXX XXXX is and that the account should be removed. The representative informed me again to contact XXXX XXXX and contact the credit bureaus as well because there was nothing she could do as my account is no longer with them. I asked her to speak to a supervisor and she would not allow me to repeating that I 'm not in their system and that there is nothing they could do. I attempted to contact XXXX XXXX but could not get anyone on the phone. I then contacted each of the credit bureaus again to find out the status of the removal / dispute and they all reported that the account came back as \\\" verified '' from the creditor. How would I be verified in a system that I 'm not in? The XXXX representative in particular told me that this was done through an automated system where they sent it to the creditor and the creditor reported back to them yes the account is accurately being reported. Again, how could they say that when according to XXXX XXXX I was not in their system? I do not believe proper verification was done by any of the credit bureaus.On XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to get in touch with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX who said they did acknowledge the restrictive endorsement agreement and was forwarding the information over to their attorney who would get back with me on when this account would be updated and removed from my credit report.

Weve enclosed a copy of the letter we sent you on XX/XX/XXXX, explaining this decision. The information regarding your experience with XXXX has been forwarded to management and will be handled accordingly. We take complaints that claim discrimination very seriously and investigate them thoroughly. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination as it is strictly against our policy and contrary to our corporate culture. We thoroughly investigated your concerns and can assure you there was no discrimination in this matter. HE WAS RUDE AND VERY DISREPECTFUL AND HE DID THIS IN THE PAST TO ME WHEN WE DID OUR OTHER MODIFICATION, I THINK HE DISLIKES US. HE IS VERY JUDGEMENTAL AND RUDE. HE WASNT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. HE HAS BEEN THERE A LONG TIME SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY I FEEL WE WERE TREATED IS NOT RELEVANT IN YOUR EYES??? apologize for any confusion regarding the date you are eligible to reapply for a loan modification. The earliest we can accept an application for review is XX/XX/XXXX. WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF THIS UNTIL SOMEONE IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE INFORMED US OF THIS, THE MONTHS HAVE BEEN WRONG EVERY TIME WE HAVE ASKED. WE WERE TOLD XX/XX/XXXX, THEN XX/XX/XXXX, THEN XX/XX/XXXX, AND THEN WE WERE TOLD XX/XX/XXXX, EVERYONE HAS GIVEN THE WRONG MONTHS. This is because your previous modification was effective on XX/XX/XXXX. Your loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ), and we must abide by their guidelines. The FHA has a strict rule allowing no more than one modification within 24 months. We apologize that you were not provided with timely information regarding the FHA modification restrictions. IM VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU HAVE APOLOGIZS, BUT THAT SITUATION HAS CAUSED US TO FALL FURTER BEHIND. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF WE WERE GIVEN THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN THE BEGINNING. THAT IS NEGLECT ON YOUR PART AS A COMPANY, YOU FAILED ME AS A CLIENT. The loss mitigation programs available to you at this time are unemployment plans, forbearance/repayment plans, modifications, a short sale and a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. There is no underemployment or death in the family assistance programs. A refinance is a completely separate process and is not part of the loss mitigation process. WE WERE NEVER TOLD THAT PROGRAM WAS SEPARATE, WE COULD HAVE TRIED THAT OPTION IF WE WERE TOLD IT WAS SEPARATE, WE COULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR IT IN THE BEINGING IF WE WERE GIVEN THAT OPTION. WE DID ASK ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES AND WE JUST FOUND OUT IT WAS A SEPARATE PROCESS. The Informal Forbearance is available if the account is 60 days or less past due ; the Formal Forbearance is available if the account is three payments or more delinquent and the delinquency can be cured within six months or less. WE WERE NEVER GIVEN THE FORBEARANCE OPTION. WE ASKED FOR HELP WHEN WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO BE A MONTH BEHIND. The Special Forbearance is only for customers who are unemployed. Unfortunately, the HOPE for Homeowners and the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program ended in XX/XX/XXXX WE ASKED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN THE BEGINNING AN NO ONE TOLD US THIS INFORMATION UNTIL KNOW. Loss mitigation options are reviewed in a specific order. You are offered the first loss mitigation option that you qualify for. The review order, if employed, is repayment/forbearance plan, modification, short sale, and then deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. For the repayment plan to be approved, we must be able to cure the delinquency within three or six months using only 85 % of your surplus monthly income. For the repayment plan offered on XX/XX/XXXX, we took the monthly income you provided us by phone on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$6500.00}, minus the expenses of {$4900.00}, which included your current payment of {$1900.00}, which leaves {$1500.00} as your total monthly income surplus. We then multiplied this amount by 85 %. It equaled {$1300.00} as the available monthly income surplus by which we could calculate a repayment plan. We determined the delinquency amount at the time of the review to be {$13000.00}. We set the first months payment at {$1000.00} and divided the remaining balance by five, which equaled four monthly payments of {$2500.00}, and one monthly payment of {$2500.00}. Because we were able to provide an affordable repayment plan, additional loss mitigation options were not reviewed. WE TOLD THEM WE COULD NOT AFFORD THAT HIGH OF A PAYMENT AND WE WERE INFORMED TO REAPPLAY TO SEE WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE. WE DID THIS OVER AND OVER ONLY TO KEEP GETTING LIED TO OVER AN OVER FOR MONTHS. WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO BY THE EXECTUVE OFFICE IN WHICH WE THOUGHT THEY WERE THE ONES TO HELP US? WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE BEEN SWEPT UNDER THE RUG, UNTIL WE PUT IN THIS COMPLAINT AND XXXX DID SOME RESEARCH AS WELL. WE RECEIVED THE SAME INFORMATION FOR MONTHS AND NO ONE ANSWERED THE QUESTION WE ASKED FOR MONTHS, THAT CAUSED MORE ISSUES FOR US IN REGARDS TO KEEPING OUR HOME. WE ARE AT FAULT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE EXCULATED TO THIS MATTER IF THE QUESTTIONS WERE ADDRESSED IN THE BEGINNING. We have reviewed the past modification income submissions and have found various reasons why your income was not included. On some reviews, your information was not included on the Request for Mortgage Assistance. For others, we were able to use your gross income, but not your net income as your expenses exceeded your income. As you have confirmed, we were able to use your income in some of the reviews. WE INFORMED THAT MY WIFES INCOME WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE APART OF THE MODIFICATION, WHICH I DONT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE TO GET THE LOAN WE USED HER INCOME? THIS WAS JUST BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AS WELL. If youd like copies of the documents we used as part of our review, please send a written request to : Chase XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX If youd like to reapply for assistance, please call us right away at XXXX.

The representative told me they had not received payment from me. I explained to her that her company sent emails stating they had received funds. In addition, the funds were taken from my account. I began to feel uneasy and told her I wanted to cancel the accounts and receive a refund. I asked to speak with a supervisor.

I left the car and signed off on the mileage and leased a new car, a XXXX RAV4. The dealership representative, XXXX, sorry it is true, did not complete the paperwork. I continued to get a bill for the car I gave back. I spoke to Toyota Financial Services several times. They were less than helpful and even tried to say that they did n't care about the dealership, that I had a contract with them. They said, they knew obviously that I did not have both cars. It was only after I told them that I had a contract with them and would be in that night to pick up the Camry that they panicked and located the papers where I of course had signed off on the mileage and traded in the car in XX/XX/XXXX. They had the nerve to put on my credit bureau that I was delinquent in paying my car payment for the car I did not have since XX/XX/XXXX when I gave it back. They billed me for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX etc. It was only through a mortgage refinance inquiry that I found out they did this. When I tried to call them, 3 times, each time they left me on hold for 50 plus moments and then would suddenly be gone, leaving me to have to call again and start the 50 minute process of waiting, never having helped me. I am beside myself with anger. I have been a customer of theirs for 20 years. I have never been late or missed a car payment when I bought or leased a car. This is unacceptable. They also promised me when I spoke to them and they realized their error, that this would not happen. I am going to make a complaint against the dealership as well and I hope to have the person fired that handled my car. Often people consider what that could involve, but in this case it is appropriate.

Their suggestion was to assist me with a modification application. I found out several months later that there were far more effective ways to reduce my interest rate ( potentially a streamline refinance ). Furthermore the modification, while approved, was terminated as a consequence of my lack of financial hardship. Before applying, I had actively stated to my servicer as well as the counseling agency, that I did not have a financial hardship. The goal was strictly to reduce my interest rate. Now, my sister is very ill, and I have been traveling back and forth from my home in XXXX, to her home in XXXX. During this time, I was unaware that the modification had been terminated, and the monthly payments I had made were not the appropriate amount. Consequently, the delinquency started to have a negative impact on my credit and prevented me from more appropriate refinance options.

My husband and I were approved for an FHA loan through Navy Federal for a home ( New Construction ) in XXXX XXXX, Florida. We have been working with our loan officer, XXXX XXXX and Closing Agent, XXXX XXXX for numerous months. We completed all the needed documentation in preparation for closing. We were told by the builder, XXXX that the property was complete on XX/XX/XXXX and that we should contact our lender to order the final appraisal. XXXX informed us that the final appraisal was ordered on XX/XX/XXXX. We received an e-mail from her indicating that she would be on vacation the week of our scheduled closing. My husband spoke with her on the phone XX/XX/XXXX and we were told that the final appraisal was complete and we received an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX indicating a \\\" clear to close ''. No stipulations were placed indicating that any outstanding information was needed. We were told by XXXX via e-mail that we would receive a call on XX/XX/XXXX and we would need to respond to the disclosures by XXXX My husband received a phone call from XXXX XXXX after XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that we would not be able to close on XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled as the bank did not have an appraisal. We were then forwarded to a supervisor, XXXX XXXX, who also indicated that we would not close on XX/XX/XXXX as the bank had not received the final appraisal. We were very confused and we repeatedly indicated that we were told that the final appraisal had already been received. She indicated that they would do everything to get the appraisal as soon as possible. She indicated she was doing everything she could and would call us back after speaking to her supervisor. When she called us back she indicated that if we send a \\\" Hold Harmless Letter '' that we could still close if the appraisal was received by the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. We forwarded the letter. We continued to call for regular updates. However, it was not until the evening XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX XXXX told my husband that they had received the final appraisal in a timely manner but it was not on a form acceptable for FHA and this was in fact the hold up. She had clearly left out this key piece of information in our earlier conversations. \\nIt appears to me that some discrepancy is not being shared with us regarding the final appraisal. Ethically, is the bank required to share the reason for the problems with the appraisal? For example, did the home not appraise for the anticipated value? If so, does the bank have an obligation to share this information with the customer? We feel that representatives from the bank were fully aware that appraisal was received on time and that there was a problem regarding the appraisal. Additionally, there was no follow-up by the bank until the last minute to ensure that the documentation was correct is an issue demonstrating unprofessionalism. I feel that ethically some violations have occurred on the part of NFCU thus the reason we were asked to sign the \\\" Hold Harmless ''. We were told different stories at different times by XXXX XXXX. If we knew that the paperwork was in fact received, then we would not have been manipulated into signing the \\\" hold harmless '' letter. \\nLastly, the bank transferred nearly XXXX from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX to the title company for the closing. To date my husband and I have no further information regarding closing or the status of the appraisal or the status of my funds. For example, how long will the funds be held? \\nThere are clearly some larger issues happening with the appraisal that have not been shared. We would like an honest assessment from Navy Federal Credit Union about the status of our closing and whether they will be able to close the loan.\",\"I called Midland funding to offer a settlement on a very old debt.

From the start I have signed up for automatic debit to receive the discount interest rate that they provide when doing so. To pay off my loans faster I typically make a large payment on the loan with the highest interest rate the week after the auto debit. When doing so, it prompts me with a question of \\\" do you want to advance your payoff date '' or \\\" would you like to make your next scheduled payment ''. I always select to make my next scheduled payment so I can pay it off as soon as possible. However, when my next auto debit comes out they the payment for the loan may be {$20.00} or {$140.00} but they will only put a few cents to a couple dollars towards it instead of putting the original payment towards it like i selected. The remaining amount is split between the rest of my loans ( got ta remember, I 'm paying the highest interest rate loans so they are putting my payment towards lower interest rate loans ). When I questioned them regarding this, they stated that my loans are in a group and the only way to fix it would be for me to cancel my auto debit. Now how does that make sense? Remove my auto debit so that they can continue my normal payment that I stated clearly that I would like to continue. Why ask me if they are n't going to continue my normal payment anyways? This happens every month since the inception. Cancelling my auto debit would increase my interest rate for all of my loans by a .5 %. That 's the dumbest thing I 've ever heard. I 'll take the hit of misallocating instead of a hike in my interest rate for {$30000.00} in loans. Get real Navient. \\n\\nI also had issues with their old site where they did n't have the functionality to select a specific loan to pay extra on. I could only make an extra payment and request that it go to a specific loan. Then I would hope that they would see the request and allocate it properly. It was n't until a few months into making these payments that I realized they were n't doing it. I would have to call and explain to the representative what happened and request that they fix it. They told me the only way I could do this is by calling in. So I started calling in my extra payment every month and requesting it go towards the highest interest rate loan. Some of the people would understand while others would simply spread the payment across the board. Countless calls and sometimes they would fix it and others they would n't be able to. The new website rolls out and I think finally they can stop messing up and I do n't have to call in anymore. Yet they simply find another way to have a quirk to XXXX the allocation process. \\n\\nGet your stuff together Navient. Ca n't wait to get rid of you. Hopefully I 'll have my {$65000.00} paid off this year and I hope they have enjoyed being a thorn in my side and wallet.\",\"Constant daily robot calls from the CBE group with no person on the other end, just a recording.

Then they claimed that it was their personal policy. I responded by stating that there was nothing in any of my loan documents that indicated that I could not elect to pay for my own taxes and insurance and in fact there was an election that enabled me to choose what I preferred at the time the mortgage was closed. After this discussion, I was referred to an \\\" executive mortgage '' consultant who said that she would see if they could \\\" relax their requirement '' in our case. A week later, she called back to let me know that they could not. At that time I informed her that I had gotten new homeowner 's insurance and that I would be taking care of that personally.

She didnt respond and the call was ended. Here we are a week later and my escrow account and house payment have not been corrected to reflect the removal of the insurance charges.

As a XXXX, I know that this statement was a misrepresentation on many fronts. First, Great Lakes will begin assessing fees on my account the minute I stop paying my account. Second, nonpayment after thirty days will be reported to the credit bureaus, which will adversely affect my credit score and my credit history. Third, nonpayment will make the entire unpaid balance of my loan and any interest due immediately and payable immediately. And fourth, my loan account could be assigned to a collection agency, which could result in wage/Social Security garnishment and further adverse effects to my credit score. The fact that a Great Lakes representative would recognize nonpayment as a legitimate \\\" payment option '' when a customer is faced with a repayment issue is appalling. I hate to think that this is the advice that Great Lakes is giving to borrowers who need temporary assistance with repaying their student loans. Such conduct, to me, appears to be a predatory lending practice that inures in Great Lakes ' favor and not the borrowers.\",\"i took out a student loan in XXXX for {$8000.00} from XXXX. after paying on this loan i still owe {$7200.00}. i filed bankruptcy in XXXX and was told could not file this loan because it was a student loan. am XXXX now and on fixed income. told could not do loan forgiveness because it was a private loan through Bank Of America. i have paid a total of {$7400.00} which all but {$200.00} went to finance fee, late charges, and something called int capitlztn. what can i do about this problem? can you help me with this. i have paid for 10 years and can not do it anymore due to my fixed income ...\",\"___/___/___ Dear Sirs/Madams ; I recently received the paperwork regarding this case in the mail.

How will this new law help me and my fellow Americans?\",\"I have a set of XXXX Private student loans that had defaulted due to my inability to make payments on them. In 2015, I was finally able to reconcile the loans by making a lump sum payment to the loan holder 's collection subsidiary, Navient Recovery as well as arrive at a monthly, automated payment arrangement. I have been making on time, automated payments to the agency for seven months now. I pulled my credit report and much to my surprise and dismay, they continue to report that my loans are in a state of Charge-off and are not reporting that any payments are being made to make good on the debts owed. I contacted Navient Recovery directly regarding this issue and they stated that it is their business practice to decline the reporting of payments on a defaulted account. The representative I spoke with advised that I had my opportunity to make on time payments before the loan defaulted, so as to maintain a positive credit-reporting, eluding to the fact that their business practice serves as an almost righteous form of punishment. She stated that they would continue to report to all of the credit bureaus that the accounts were in a state of Charge-off with no payments being made until the entire amount owed was paid off, an amount totaling more than {$24000.00}. I am paying Navient the absolute most I can afford per month and at that current rate, I will not see these loans paid off for 9 years. \\nThis means that for 9 years, my credit will continue to never see the light of day. The negative repercussions of a charge-off in a state of nonpayment are significant. I have spoken with a credit professional and they have confirmed that this will, without relent, drag my credit down and never let it travel above a rating within the \\\" XXXX '' class. The rest of my report shows that I am an individual who has all other accounts and open lines of credit and lending in good standing after having just settled XXXX unknown small medical bills. \\nIt seems to me that the practice of reporting that no payments are being made on a debt that is without question being paid on is a fraudulent practice. Outside of being wholly incorrect, it seems to me that this would without question be considered an unfair business practice that will continue to hurt me and my family for decades to come. \\nCan you please clarify, is this an industry standard? Am I nave to think that this seems fraudulent? Do I have any course of action? With a credit rating \\\" XXXX '', I ca n't even take a loan out to pay them to get it out of charge-off, which seems counterproductive and XXXX. \\nI thank you for your time and consideration. \\nXXXX XXXX\",\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has repeatedly placed threatening phone calls to my cell phone and the phone of my XXXX father.

She contacted the creditor 's attorney to inform him the income was exempt and he sent a notice to the Bank to release the account. The bank released the account, but retained a {$120.00} processing fee. Under New York State law, the Bank is not entitled to the processing fee if the account should not have been restrained. Because the bank knew the only money in the account was direct deposited social security benefits, the account should not have been restrained.

I have requested a letter from XXXX confirming the debt is not mine. They have agreed to send it to me but have failed to do so.\",\"I have already submitted a complaint to the CFPB ( XXXX ). After doing so, SPS decided onXX/XX/XXXX to outright deny the offer they 've had for 6 months instead of requesting the correct adjustments. They responded to my inquiry on XX/XX/XXXX.\\nAll of the information placed on the HUD was entered as a result of misinformation given by SPS. I am not only dissatisfied with the decision to deny the offer, but I feel that this entire process has been dishonest. At this point, I am requesting additional assistance with the process as I have no trust for the company I am involuntarily dealing with ( XXXX turned my loan over to SPS ). SPS employees have lied and provided incorrect information for months from the time they became the servicer of the loan. Phone records will indicate that they have not provided the correct information and would like access to the review of those records. Do I need to obtain a lawyer in order to have those records reviewed?\\nThe letter attached to the CFPB inquiry response further indicates dishonesty on behalf of SPS. The letter indicates that SPS spoke with me with regards to my inquiry - I never mentioned the CFPB inquiry to any SPS employee. I called SPS on XX/XX/XXXX for an update on my account and was informed at that time that the offer was denied. I then requested to speak with a manager. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX ( for over 90 minutes ) who indicated that the offer was not denied but the HUD needed to be corrected. The information is conflicting. The letter explains changes that need to be made on the current offer, but indicates that the offer is denied and that I can submit another offer. This is unclear. Is the current offer still on the table as long as the changes are made?\\nSPS has indicated the following : 1. Remove {$6000.00} seller 's concession - it has been there since the original offer was submitted and was never mentioned in any of the document corrections.\\n2. Line XXXX - SPS agents indicated on more than one occasion that {$8500.00} was the amount to place on that line. Misinformation.\\n3. Reduce title fees - why was that never mentioned before? It 's not a problem for the attorney to reduce them - but the fees have been there for several versions of the HUD, including those that were \\\" approved '' except for one outstanding change.\\nFurther, after six months ( and my CFPB inquiry was submitted ), on XXXX/XXXX/17 an SPS manager indicated that this particular \\\" investor '' does not offer relocation assistance and that someone there should have told me that. Instead, various SPS agents had previously instructed me to enter an amount ( {$10000.00} ), then reduce ( to {$5600.00} ), then raise ( to {$10000.00} ), then reduce ( to {$0.00} ) the amount for relocation assistance. My attorney did n't initially include any amount until first directed to do so by SPS. At this point, this update seems retaliatory as it came after the complaint to CFPB was filed.\\nThe letter from the Ombudsman does not address my concerns about process and honesty. The \\\" I 'm sorry you 're not satisfied with our service '' letter indicates how much control this bank has over its customers. The letter reduces my concerns to the length of time this process has taken which is a trivial misrepresentation of my initial inquiry. There is not just a denial, but a gross ( and potentially illegal ) injustice at play. Short sales are stressful, fine - but the process should be honest, legal, and fair every step of the way. This one has not been. The retaliatory decision to reject the offer is indicative of that.\\nIt should also be noted that SPS creatively ran down the clock when the loan was transferred to them last fall. The result of this : I had to submit a new application after XX/XX/XXXX, the sunset date of the HAMP program. XXXX had already provided an approval to do a short sale and yet, SPS took untilXX/XX/XXXX to provide the same approval. They lied and said I did not allow an appraiser into my home and closed my original application with XXXX. Again, I would be happy to review phone records to prove the absolute dishonesty of their claims.\\nOnce again, SPS has run down the clock. This decision comes with just 30 days to submit an offer, go through an unreasonable process and sell the property. There is no way this can by done by XX/XX/XXXX, based on SPS ' performance thus far. While I certainly intend to try get an approval and close in just 30 days, I am skeptical about the servicer handling a new or revised offer with the integrity, efficiency, or expedience that will be needed to do so.\\nCFPB, consumers like me need help.

There was some ambiguity and XXXX customer service rep insisted on putting a dispute on XXXX of the airline charges even though I made it clear I was not disputing, just trying to identify the charge. Subsequently I did identify the charge and submitted it for payment. Amex accepted this payment, and then later charged the same amount again when they removed their charge dispute from the account. I did not see this because, not having travelled in months I did not check statements or the dashboard because no new charges had been made. \\nThen in XXXX they emailed me and said my account was delinquent {$920.00}, and they insisted on a XXXX payment of the same amount.

They insist that I reconcile the account. The dates and descriptions of their charges in their statements do not match the dates that they populate to my company 's portal for expense processing.

My response to the rep is that most alternative loan sites do n't normally do hard pulls so you can not assume all consumers will understand that.

I am participating in a 0 % interest promotion for 60 months. In order to qualify for such a promotion, a customer must have a good to excellent credit history. I work very hard to ensure that all of my debts are paid before their listed due dates. \\nIn XXXX 2016, Synchrony charged me a late fee stating that my payment was not processed by my statement 's due date. In XXXX 2016, I was charged another late fee in a higher amount because I did not pay the minimum payment on my XXXX 2016 statement. I received XXXX emails, that went to my junk folder, and XXXX mailed communication stating that no payment had been received, which was false. My issue is, on the statement Synchrony states, \\\" Payment due by XXXX XXXX on the due date. '' My due date for my Rooms to Go credit card is the XXXX of the month. I have an electronic payment sent from my financial institution automatically each month on the XXXX. If the XXXX falls on a Saturday or Sunday, my bank will send the payment out on the Friday before the XXXX. When I spoke to individuals at Synchrony, they stated that it takes 3-5 business days to process payments. In their words, I must ensure that my payment is received by Synchrony five days before the due date listed on my monthly statement. When I asked to find out when my payments have been received by Synchrony, I was informed that I would need a subpoena to obtain that information. I was also informed that it did not matter if I sent a personal check, a check from my bank account, or an electronic payment as they all take the same amount of time to process. \\nSynchrony is sending out monthly statements that state customers have a specific due date, yet they are enforcing an unpublished policy that all payments must be processed before the stated due date. Because of their unpublished policy, they are assessing late charges and interest and jeopardizing consumers participating in zero interest promotions, which could potentially damage our creditworthiness. As part of our credit card agreement, we must make our payments on time or risk losing our promotional APR and paying an astronomical 29.99 % on large-ticket items. \\nThere is a big difference between receiving a payment and processing a payment. A company can hold on to a payment for as long as they want to before they process it and a consumer has little to no recourse. Surprisingly, when I demanded that the late fees and interest be removed from my statements, Synchrony did this with little to no fanfare. When I asked for documentation of the outcome of our conversation, they refused stating that confirmation would be listed on my next statement. I demanded documentation again and was told it would take 24-48 for them to send me an email. It has been over 48 hours and I am still waiting. \\nAs a side note, my husband is the primary account holder on a BP credit card also financed by Synchrony. For that card in XXXX they charged interest and a late fee stating that payment was not received by the due date. Again, this was a situation when Synchrony had received payment before the due date but did not process the payment for several days. \\nI now live in fear that Synchrony will enact some other unpublished policy that will adversely impact me and force me to pay an astronomical interest rate on my furniture purchase.\",\"To whom concerned : I received paperwork from Ditech Mortgage my Homeowners/Hazard Insurance for property XXXX ( account number XXXX ) was expired or cancelled dated XXXX.

Today is XXXX XXXX, and my buyers are allowed 30 days to title/license the car they bought, but they need release from the lien to show the title is clear. The lien release was delivered to me by mail on XXXX XXXX. I called the bank today because the last time I talked to them they said they would be mailing a new title, so I called to say the title is not here and late fees are going to be assessed against my buyers. I learned today that being told I would receive a title was a mistake, I will only be receiving the lien release letter and that 's all I need. I 'm not concerned about that mistake, but mention it because if I had n't called the bank today to say today is the last day and I still do n't have it, I would n't know I 'm not going to get a new title and I would still be waiting for it, which would impact my buyers. I 've called the bank XXXX times during XXXX about getting the required documentation for my buyers. I mailed the payoff on the XXXX, they received it on the XXXX, they posted it on the XXXX, they allow 10 business days to clear the cashiers check I sent them, they mailed the lien release letter on the XXXX, and it arrived on the XXXX. This allows 1 day to get it to my buyers, who are at work, and XXXX minutes away, and the DMV closes at XXXX, so they 're going to pay late fees. I explained this to the bank on XXXX occasions, talking to XXXX and XXXX, and then talking to XXXX supervisors on separate occasions ( XXXX and XXXX ). They all acknowledge that the process was executed by the bank without mistakes and that the end result is that the title does n't get here it time. No one would take the initiative to at least SAY that it 's a problem for the customer, they 're established process that was executed without error did n't allow the customer to get the required documentation to the buyer within the 30 days allowed by state law to avoid late fees. THAT 's what I 'm complaining about. They KNOW this and are n't doing anything about it. When they told me last week the letter was mailed on the XXXX, they said it would take 10 business days to get it. They KNEW at that time I would n't get it in time. They could have changed their shipping method to get it here quickly. The problem is they know their process did n't work for the customer and they acknowledge this but do n't volunteer to improve the process. They do n't like regulation, but there 's a reason for it, and this is an example. Apparently they need to have a regulation to require them to execute a process that allows the customer to receive the required documentation in time to comply with state law without having to pay penalties.\",\"I recently paid off my mortgage from DiTech - PAID OFF - and yet, to this day, DiTech has n't returned my escrowed tax reserve.

The problem stems from them changing the amounts due. I have my XXXX mortgages, a XXXX, and a full-time job to run, and as such I receive upwards of XXXX pieces of relevant mail every month, so reconciling each and every figure against my automated bill-pay amounts, will occasionally result in incorrect amounts. This is NOT the same as missing a payment. In all bad reporting situations, my payments were more than sufficient to cover the due interest and principal, but there was a shortage on the escrow payment. Escrow payments are projected estimates. When Ocwen overestimates the escrow, they send me a check at the end of the year, without interest. When I underpay my escrow, they report to the credit bureaus that I MISSED a payment altogether! How is this justified that they can overcharge escrow, but when I miss a fractional amount of an escrow payment, they can penalize me like I 'm completely irresponsible and destroy my credit?? I 've appealed to them but they respond with robotic zeal and refuse to accommodate me. Other banks send ebills to my bank so the payments adjust automatically ; and if you miss a payment with any other lender, they give you a courtesy call to make you aware of the change in payment amount. Not Ocwen, they have nothing but paper bills ( what century is this?? ), and if you 're XXXX cents below the amount, they just destroy your credit with not a warning whatsoever. Because of this company, my credit remains damaged to the point that I can not refinance, causing me to spiral out of control in my debt as the ARMs adjust.

When contacting Seterus they claim no documentation has been submitted to prove the bankruptcy is finalized. They prevent access to my account online except payment. Seterus refuses to talk to me without attorney approval due to active bankruptcy which is false. When able to talk to bankruptcy department they always state the mortgage has not been reaffirmed. XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my mortgage for a better rate and no longer had Seterus as a provider for my account. XX/XX/XXXX my refinanced loan was returned to Seterus for services, which is proof enough that my mortgage has been reaffirmed. Law will not allow a refinance on a mortgage that is not reaffirmed. XX/XX/XXXX after numerous times before, Seterus again put my account in active bankruptcy. This time they reported to the credit bureau that my account has been closed, delinquent, and in active bankruptcy. Seterus claims they did not submit that report but submitted to the credit bureau reaffirmation of my account due to my request, which is false.

XXXX complaint regarding the mortgage practices of XXXX Bank. Immediately, my mortgage was sold to Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc. which continued the servicing abuses initiated by XXXX. The intent of both thse companies to 'take my property ''. First of all, I was unaware of my mortgage transfer until Select Portfolio Servicing began sending to mail regarding my delinquency. I challenged their accounting record received from XXXX. As a matter of documentation, I sent them copies of all my payments to XXXX. SPS, Inc. began to establish an escrow account and increased my initial mortgage payment. I informed SPS, Ic., I was responsible for paying my taxes and insurance on my property. XXXX as well as SPS, Inc. has not properly applied my payments instead place these payments in suspension. Therefore, it would appear I have not paid my monthly mortgage. Since, I have been with servicers, I have not missed XXXX payments and continued to be current on my initial mortgage agreement. I sent them the copies of my taxes and insurance documents. The next thing this mortgage began to do is to add late fees to my account and exercising an escrow account I never agreed upon and quite frankly, did not owe these payments. Several letters were sent regarding loan modification and threaten foreclosure. I informed them initially, I could pay my mortagage, my dispute was the inaccurate delinquencies attached to my mortgage based on what XXXX had sent to SPS, Inc. Due to continously sending letters to their CEO and the customer service division, I decided to send a lump sum certified letter to their CEO with the cashier check with the amount I calculated I owed. Hopwever, this amount to this date was not posted to my account. Instead, this mortgage servicer continues to submit negative reports to the Credit Bureau which has destroyed my credit. When I disputed the inacuracies on my credit report from SPS , Inc., via documentation of payments dated back to XXXX, the Credit Bureau ( all XXXX ) ignored my disputes and simply stated what was reported to them from the mortgage servicer. I have attempted all avenues to resolve this matter but, the mortage servicer has gotten away with these illegal abuses of servicing my loan. Again, I do not owe these delinquent fees being reported and want justice. This has been an awful journey with XXXX and now, SPS, Inc. My imnitial contact with CFPB was not useful nor productive. It appears there was no oversight for these type of mortgage abuses which contributes to the high rates of foreclosure. I can pay my mortgage but, it is difficult to these mortgage services who intent is to take property worked so hard to pay for. Currently, my mortgage interest rate is 11 % initially with XXXX and continues with SPS, Inc. I want to refinance to reduce this interest rate but with the negative reporting on my credit report, I am unable to refinance due to the credit score. It is time the government protect it consumers from illegal practices against citizens who work hard and pay their debts. It is my hope CFPB vigorously assist me which is the nmission of this agency. If not, I am truly disappointed!\",\"I believe in the month of  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , De  XXXX   XXXX  this company had an inquiry on my credit report that I did not authorize.an illegal inquiry.\",\"Hello, I tried to disbute my credit report online but by the time I cut my words to the XXXX that fit in the box, site said I took to long and closed me out.

We have been with Wells Fargo for 10+ years and always paid XXXX mortgage accounts on time every month. \\nWe contacted Wells Fargo for advice on our mortgage payments to see if we could reduce the interest on either loan. We were advised at the time by a Wells Fargo Loan Preservationist that the value of our home was less than what we owned so we could not refinance. The Wells Fargo Loan Preservationist stated that the ONLY way to qualify for any assistance ( i.e. Loan Modification ) we would have to allow our mortgage to go past due by 1 month. We of course were very concerned of not paying our mortgage payment but we were assured once again - this was the only way they could assist us in lowering our payments. \\n\\nUpon the Wells Fargo Loan Preservation 's advice and against our own belief 's we allowed our payment to fall behind 1 month so they would help us with a Loan Modification. The Loan Modification started and we were continually advised by Wells Fargo Loan Preservationist to NOT to make any payments. My husband and I ALWAYS pay our bills ON TIME. We agreed only to do the 1 month that Wells Fargo told us to do and from there we made our payments each and every month. We were not disclosed at ANY TIME that when we made our payments that it would continually roll on our credit as a 30 day late and lower our credit rating which just furthers our financial hardship instead of helping. \\n\\nDuring the process, we had several Wells Fargo Loan Preservationists. I was offended by the last Loan Modification Preservationist who advised that maybe I should get a better job. I have a XXXX great job I advised, I wanted an update as to what was going on with the modifications. I was never informed as to why this process was being transferred from XXXX Wells Fargo Loan Preservationist or another which is no excuse for the poor service we were getting. \\n\\nExhausted by the entire process and NEVER receiving any kind of communication from Wells Fargo. We wanted an update so we finally demanded to speak to a Manager. The Manager failed to research or case and went off of his gut feeling rather than looking at our account and actually reading the forms. We were told over the phone that we did not qualify. The Manager stated that usually if you do n't get a loan modification on the first then you do n't on the second mortgage. We pleaded with him to review the account and the notes. Once the account was researched a second time we were offered a slight reduction in our principal balance on our second mortgage. In desperation, we had to accept it. \\n\\nWe would like to formally request that this matter be reviewed in detail. We were reminded every time I called Wells Fargo that the calls are recorded for quality purposes. I would like all the calls to be retrieved and reviewed. This will show that at any time we were NOT disclosed and told this would have the financial hardship and negative credit impact that it has on us on a personal level and a business level. \\n\\nIt should be noted, again, that we have NOT missed a payment prior ( 10 YEARS XXXX and that we were advised to miss by a Wells Fargo Loan Preservationist. We would have NEVER allowed the payment to go past due if we were properly disclosed of the outcome that it would have to us personally and professionally. \\n\\nOur request is simple, we are requesting that Wells Fargo permanently remove all credit late payments from all three credit bureaus and supply us with a letter that states we were never late on either our first or second mortgage.

I have been making my monthly payments through automatic debit ( which provides a slight decrease in my apr and defaults to the amount that they expect to be due ... even if I pay ahead it 's always a specific amount ). I recently realized that breaking my payment into bi-weekly payments would help me pay off the loan sooner and with less interest. \\n\\nI contacted AES and requested that my automatic debit amount be changed. I first requested that it be taken out bi-weekly but they said they ca n't do that.

And then I could go in and enter a manual payment for the rest. They said they ca n't do that. \\n\\nIn no other industry have I encountered a company that wo n't let me automatically debit the amount that I request.

The forced placed caused an escrow shortage which the servicer attempted to cure by increasing my monthly mortgage payment amount. This new mortgage payment amount proved to be a hardship to me which caused me to fall behind on my mortgage payments. After some months of trying to request a correction of the error. I was offer a Forbearance Plan by Kondaur Capital Corporation. However, in their effort to assist they made a fatal error that may cause me to lose my home. Attached is the letter written and dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 offering the Forbearance Agreement and the executed Forbearance Agreement. The problem is that the agreement directed for the commencement of the agreement initial payment to be paid by XXXX XXXX, 2014. This was a fatal flaw in the agreement. It provided only two ( 2 ) days. The letter was not received by the borrower thru the XXXX mail until the XXXX of XXXX, 2014. Nevertheless, the Borrower XXXX XXXX signed the agreement and mailed all XXXX of the required payments dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 to Kondaur Capital Corporation in advance in good faith ( proof is attached ). The Borrower subsequently received notice from Kondaur Capital Corporation that the Forbearance Agreement was cancelled because she paid the amount due after the required date of XXXX XXXX, 2014 as per the agreement. Months and months of trying to get someone at Kondaur Capital Corporation to acknowledge and correct their error went unanswered. To further exasperate this matter, Kondaur Capital Corportion refused to return the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX payments. Kondaur has since refued to work with me to correct their error and began foreclosure proceedings. To make matters worst, they transferred my the servicing and rights to my mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Florida. This new entity will not negotiate with me, will not cooperate to bring my mortgage current.

When I graduated, I was enouraged by    XXXX   XXXX  /  Navient to  consolidate my federal loans with my private loans, which they held and I was encouraged to put my loans in forbearance several times when I asked for help with repayment terms that would make my payments more manageable, as I was just starting out as a public school teacher. They told me that there were few options for repayment and that forbearance was the easiest. They offered no alternative plans or solutions.     In addition, when I became a teacher and learned about public loan forgiveness act, I called several times to inquire about qualifying loans and was told that I would n't qualify and that I was already on the lowest payment plan and that my loans did n't qualify for forgiveness. I ended up contacting the federal government to consolidate all my federal loans with them and am now on year  four  of the plan.     I have been repeatedly given bad information. This information cost me several years of loan forgiveness I could have had through the public loan forgiveness act because I 've been a teacher for 10 years.

I feel I 've been kept in debt by them through these interest rates and feel there is no way to get out.

The mortgage payment had recently gone up to {$860.00} so I planned to pay {$920.00} instead of {$850.00}. Thinking I was editing the payment which was scheduled to go out the next day, I actually created a new payment of {$920.00}. By the time I realized what I had done, it was impossible to undo it. I initially contacted XXXX XXXX hoping they could stop/retrieve the payment. Because I created the payment after XXXX there was nothing they could do until the next morning. But since the payment was scheduled to go out for the next day, it was already in process by the next morning. They eventually explained that Seterus only allows them to send electronic payments, not paper checks. So since it was an electronic payment, they suggested I contact Seterus. \\n\\nI contacted Seterus the next day ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and explained that the extra payment was sent unintentionally and that I want it back. The first person I spoke with was an agent who identified himself as XXXX XXXX. He said right off the bat that the payment would be applied to the principle. I objected and told him I could not afford to send XXXX payments ; that it was an accident and that I wanted my money back. He told me to contact the bank and stop payment on the check. That 's when I found out from XXXX XXXX that Seterus only allowed electronic payments from them. \\n\\nOn XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke with an agent who identified herself as XXXX. She said the payments had not arrived but that when they arrived she would \\\" set a task '' to reverse the payment. I called back on the XXXX and several times between the XXXX and the XXXX. The automated recording noted at each call that Seterus received a payment of {$1700.00} on the XXXX and that my next payment was due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. That never changed although I was being told by XXXX XXXX XXXX that my refund was \\\" in process ''. \\n\\nI had to retell the story to every agent I spoke to. Each time I asked to speak to a supervisor, but was told he ( XXXX XXXX ) was either busy or that they could resolve it for me. I felt like I was being given the run around. They told me in order to get a refund I needed to produce a letter from my bank to prove that I was n't asking for the refund because my account was overdrawn. I have to admit this was stupid and made me angry. I argued it was none of their business whether my account was overdrawn ( it was n't ). After all, they were putting money back into it, not taking money out. Even my banker argued to Seterus ' rude supervisor, XXXX XXXX, that no mortgage company required such, including XXXX which they work with on a regular basis. I objected, but since they insisted, I faxed them a letter from the bank as they required. They emailed me on the XXXX that they received the fax. \\n\\nI expected that my money was in route after the XXXX. On Friday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke to an agent identifying herself as XXXX XXXX. She clarified that I wanted the {$850.00} refunded and the {$59.00} extra applied to principle reduction. She said that she would request the refund and that it would take XXXX business days. I clarified that the XXXX was Day 1 of the 5 business days. So I expected to have my {$850.00} in my account by Friday the XXXX, since XXXX would cancel out XXXX day. Needless to say, the money never came. I spoke with an agent identifying himself as XXXX. He found my situation very funny and then put me hold forever. I eventually hung up and called back later and spoke with an agent identifying herself as XXXX. She said it actually takes 14 days to receive a refund. Then she dropped a bombshell. She said she did not see anywhere in the file where a request for a refund was ever submitted. So Seterus lied to me under the tutelage and guidance of XXXX XXXX XXXX. My money was never returned.

I obtained XXXX XXXX jobs to make XXXX sources of income and they then stated it was too high. They have asked how many adults living in the household and were told to send in a contribution letter and were told that I needed to reduce my income because it was too high to qualify for a modification. I feel as if they are trying to intentionally foreclose on me. I use to have a relationship manager, XXXX XXXX, but at one point she was no longer my contact person and I was never made aware of this until I called and until this day I have n't been assigned another XXXX. I am left to speak with different individuals every time I call that always provide me with varying information.

Even when I request something in writing about why my modification is denied am told I ca n't get a written reason why. \\nCurrently, when I call to speak with a representative they continue to give me the same message that the house is under modification and that I should not send in any payments. After all that I was greeted with a foreclosure notice although the home is still under a modification process and I am still not allowed to send in any payments unless it is for the total amount of approximately {$46.00}, XXXX. According to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB XXXX foreclosure is usually filed after the 4th month of missed payment but my mortgage was allowed to go 46 months unpaid before a foreclosure notice was filed and this is because for those entire 46 months I was told I was under a loan modification process and could n't send in payment during that time. They failed to communicate with me while I had an attorney although I attempted several times which is also XXXX the reasons why I had to get an attorney. My then attorney XXXX XXXX whom I had retained for approximately 2 years while he aided in trying to attain the loan modification also confirmed to me that while they are trying to work out the loan modification that I am not to submit any payments for my mortgage. During the time he was working as my attorney neither my servicing company nor lender would supply me information. I was always referenced to speak with my attorney regarding the matter because they could n't speak to me but only through my attorney. Also while my attorney was working for me in the initial stages he informed that my mortgage had been sold from the original company, which I was never made aware of and leads to more confusion. I feel like my attempt to hire an attorney to help mitigate the situation failed because nothing came of it and I feel as if the mortgage company did n't cooperate as they should have since nothing was ever achieved. \\nDespite the modification and past due amount I have been willing to send in payments in which I still continue to be told not to do so. I do n't understand what is needed and/or expected of me from the servicers/lenders. For over 3 years I was under the assumption that I am in the process of being approved for a loan modification that was n't the intention of the servicing company at all. I feel as if their practices are unfair and deceptive and that I as the consumer was taken advantage of. I have always kept an open communication with them on my behalf and really need to know how can someone be allowed to go 46 months without payment without being foreclosed on if what I have mentioned in the above writing is n't true. Furthermore, some form of reasonable and feasible mitigation needs to occur so that I can keep my house.\",\"I was forclosed on by suntrust on XXXX 2013.

I had a XXXX XXXX acct where I was charged for an auto repair that was never done yet the auto mechanic would not give me back my vehicle without payment of which I used my XXXX XXXX card and immediately filed a dispute with them explaining what happened. The mechanic lied to them about the charge of which they told me I had to get another mechanic repair report of which was submitted. They refused to accept the report that the work was not done that was paid for and would not remove it. I continued to complain to them about it as they were sending me statements of which I had to pay even though I did not receive the auto repair that was charged for. So I told them I could no longer send payments for something I never received. My XXXX XXXX acct was eventually bought by XXXX XXXX. That hurt my credit history of which I then contacted the MN Attorney General for help. They were very good in helping me with this problem and were able to force XXXX XXXX to remove the derogatory information that was hurting me as I am in the middle of buying a home!

Equifax said the XXXX XXXX information has not been updated since last year!!! I asked them why their information is n't current? They said it is up to the company 's to update information on customers accts. I filed a dispute today but am very upset that the credit reporting agency 's are not requiring monthly reporting for the public. I told them I have a letter I can fax them from the MN Atty General 's office where it states that XXXX XXXX agreed to remove this from my credit report. They said they would not accept the letter from the Atty General, they will only accept what XXXX XXXX sends them within 30 days. I do n't know what to do. I am in the middle of buying a home and this is only going to make things worse. Equifax does not have current, correct information for the consumers and something needs to be done to ensure the unsuspecting public is protected from having incorrect information as well as current information on their credit files/history. When companies buy debt from creditors they should be held to the same standard as credit card companies or anyone who extends credit. Please help me if you can! This is just not right! I have a letter from the MN Atty General Office as well as a letter from XXXX XXXX where they state they would remove this from my credit history. To date, that has NOT been done.

I have been trying to get a loan modification for a year now. During that time XXXX and now SPS has put me through a ridiculous ordeal. I have a legitimate reason for hardship. My wife lost her job a few years ago. I lost my job a year and a half ago and the job that replaced it pays much less. I also had to take care of my elderly parents and help them with their medical bills. I believe that these lenders illegally denied me for the assistance and since I 've read that they have been fined heavily for wrong doing, I was forced to hire a law firm to protect my home. I would have never gotten in this mess had XXXX XXXX not told me to get behind on my payments. They told me it was necessary to be able to qualify for the hardship assistance. Then they played games with me. They told me they never received my paperwork even though I faxed it to them multiple times. Even when I got them to admit that they received the paperwork, they said they lost it and told me I had to re-apply. They kept changing relationship managers on me and I could never get the same person on the phone twice. My mortgage is currently 54.29 % of my gross monthly income. If that is not considered a hardship by XXXX and SPS, then what is? I believe I meet every single criteria put forth by the HAMP program. My mortgage was originated prior to 2009 and I never refi 'd after that. I am hoping that someone will hold these big banks accountable for denying homeowners assistance when they clearly deserve it. I think the main reason that XXXX XXXX  is not helping me is because I have some positive equity and they want to get that money for themselves. I did not read anything on the HAMP guidelines that if a homeowner has positive equity that the lender does not have to approve them for HAMP, but maybe that is just the banks policy to maximize their profits.

I explained that they are not authorized to call my cell phone for debt collection. The clerk and his supervisor would not listen to me in spite of my repeating that I would make a payment XXXX/XXXX/2015. When I found out the 'collectors ' were outside the XXXX XXXX refused to 'preauthorize ' a debt to my checking account for XXXX/XXXX/2015, which they threatened to add additional late fees. I told them I 'd send a check with my statement 'tear off ' payment form. I explained I give no one my account information over the phone and especially not someone outside the XXXX speaking to me as if XXXX were my XXXX language ( very demeaning and degrading ) without allowing me to speak.

Before the loan was transferred to the new servicer, the previous servicer approved us for a loan modification. ( HAMP I believe ). I received a letter that we had been approved, dated XX/XX/XXXX, and our loan was transferred on XX/XX/XXXX. The new servicer/investor is refusing to honor the modification. What can I do. We really need this modification or we might lose our home\",\"I have a mortgage that I took out in XXXX to save my brothers ranch that he has lived in now for over XXXX yrs. The XXXX loan was taken over by EMC Mortgage. In XXXX I put my loans in a trust. Around XXXX my XXXX crashed and I reached out to EMC to get a loan modification. For around XXXX years I submitted over XXXX loan mod packages and they would always say they just needed XXXX more thing then XXXX more thing then after three months I needed to resend everything in again and this went on for over three years. \\nIf this was just any other property I would have not cared but my whole family has been so afraid of what my older brother would do if he lost this place. It 's only a small XXXX acres, the house is in dyer need of repairs but he has put XXXX of his life in this place and raised his XXXX girls here. When the rates were at 2 % and I know a lot of people that got those rates and I myself helped XXXX of my past clients get a loan mode at those low rates but EMC just kept stringing me out then right when EMC said I was close within a week of getting the loan mod, Chase bought the loan. Now XXXX is who the loan is with but Chase is now the servicer. So, feeling extremely frustrated, I start the whole process over again and also again, I submitted over XXXX plus loan mods with them and they did the exact same things always asking for more paperwork then saying they were missing certain docs but telling me on the phone that they got everything XXXX I faxed it in. I always got them what they wanted within a XXXX or XXXX, longest a week so was and still am extremely pro active with anything they needed. I would call each time I submitted more docs to confirm receipt and I always took notes on who I spoke with and time and they would confirm but then a week later ask for the same things or all of a sudden ask for something different that was never required before. \\nI would also get reassigned someone new every month or so which also was extremely frustrating and then they had no idea what was going on or where the last person left off so that new person took forever to get back up to speed and had to start all over again. So, during this time Chase referred me to an outside source in XXXX which asked me for {$6000.00} to complete the loan mod and I have the guys number as well as the paperwork that would assure my loan mod and thankfully I never gave them any money like a friend of mine did which turned out not to be legit but I had Chase paperwork that approved the paper I filled out with a rate and payment. \\nSo after XXXX of hours the last person I was working with at Chase said that they had an approved loan mod and that they would be getting me the paperwork out later that day or the next day. After calling that person the next day XXXX or XXXX times with no answer I finally found out through another call that Chase had sold it to XXXX. So now here I go all over again and I have heard and read horror stories about them including a friend. So needless to say I have went through the same thing with them. Promises that there is no sale date and that there would not be a sale date since we are working on a loan mod and again would get them needed paperwork within a XXXX depending on what all they needed which again once getting all of the paperwork, they would go for weeks with no answer then after a month or XXXX would ask for more paperwork then would need everything all over again. So about XXXX days ago I get paperwork that there is a judgment and a sheriffs sale date XXXX XXXX and it 's not by XXXX but with Chase who does not even have the note. I immediately called XXXX and they had no record of such a sale but when I called them again today, by some miracle they just saw it today but they could not tell me why Chase had it because again, I am in the process of a loan mod and legally they are not suppose to.\",\"They called looking for someone by a name that does not reside here.

We were also told in our HUD counseling session prior to signing the loan that we would have 6 months to settle the trust and sell the house. We settled the trust in XXXX and sent copies of the trust documents to Reverse Mortgage Solutions.

We were trying to pay off the loan and they were the only obstacle to doing so, and they repeatedly and steadfastly refused to give us the document we needed that only they could provide. They said their records showed we had never contacted them to discuss our intentions or progress, but we have well documented our correspondence and conversations with the various representatives.

In XXXX, it was very stressful and difficult to arrange for transportation in a foreign country ; however, even though I had every attention to pay before XX/XX/XXXX, I simply forgot and the realization of the different time zone. I 've notified Customer Service Research department but they denied my request.

Additionally, Carrington Mortgage still submitted the late payment to the Credit Reporting Agencies while I was disputing their decision.

The consumer is a native Spanish speaker and the following narrative is drawn from multiple sessions the consumer had in  Spanish with a Spanish-speaking housing counselor.      On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , the consumer filed a complaint with the Maryland  State Attorney General 's Office.      The consumer, who lives in Maryland, first sought assistance from the  Director of a company called  XXXX , to s ubmit a loan modification request  to M & T Bank, the  lender that originated the consumer 's home loan. By  XXXX   XXXX , almost  XXXX  months later after the consumer first met with  XXXX  staff,  XXXX   XXXX  from  XXXX  called the consumer to tell him that he needed to begin depositing a total of {$1600.00} in cash bi-weekly into his bank account. This was in addition to amount he stated was his monthly income and tax returns from the previous year.    XXXX   XXXX   director  of  XXXX  stated that the consumer needed to make those deposits in cash specifically every  XXXX  weeks. In order to qualify for the modification. When the consumer first met with  XXXX  staff, he asked specifically if he could qualify with a current income of {$16000.00}, and  XXXX   staff resp onded by stating I am the expert on this matter and I know exactly what I am doing, and you just do what I tell you to do.     The consumer was given a direct order to make a cash deposit of a specific amount in order for his modification to be approved and the consumer followed it. The consumer expressed feelings desperation to get an affordable modification, so he complied given that they ( the com  pany ) were the experts in this subject matter.\\nAs a result, the consumer was denied a modification from M & T bank because his income was too high. This was something that also raised a red flag for his ( loan modification ) case because when he tried to    reapply again with the right information, the bank did not believe the consumer.   When the first modification application was denied,  XXXX   XXXX  advised the consumer to file bankruptcy in order to stop the foreclosure and she referred him to an attorney named  XXXX , who reportedly refused to his my case because he saw the inconsistency in income and the possibility of fraud.     This consumer has tried a third time to resubmit a modification, explaining the true nature of his case t o M & T bank, and  has been denied.\",\"I have been trying to refinance my home since XXXX with Ditech.

I tried to request the XXXX and XXXX reports a second time, but received a bounce telling me to come back in 12 months.

Without any valid reason, PayPal decided to side with the buyer and his financial institute, for no justified reason other than not wanting to go against the banks which PayPal would not exist without. \\n\\nPayPal is notorious for siding with the buyer in almost every single case of this nature. Basically I was out of the gift card ( already been used ) and the buyer was returned his money.

I promptly responded via certified mail dated XXXX XXXX, 2017 delivered XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX.In this letter I reiterated that I do not owe this company any money as I have never heard of them prior to the first letter. I requested proper debt validation under the Texas Finance Code. I received a statement of bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$60.00} dated XXXX XXXX, 2017. The patient listed was NOT me.

I have recorded the date and time of these calls which I will use to pursue legal action if necessary as well as copy of phone records to prove the violation.\",\"I am writing in regards to a voicemail left on my answering service, on Wed, XXXX XXXX, 2017 at  approximately XXXX. The call was made to my residence by XXXX XXXX Macys Executive Office. My complaint in this correspondence is in reference to the message left by XXXX XXXX, whereas, she states that she was following up with me regarding a phone discussion that we had had in the prior week. Her further statement was that she wanted to let me know that she had copies of notes that verified my phone conversations with Macys Representatives, in addition, copies of letters that she stated were sent to me. Also in her phone statement, she implied that I was incorrect per my complaint because the copies of notes/letters were her validation. However, as I have stated to XXXX XXXX prior and I will continue to stand by my word, in regards to the last payment applied, and the conversation that the Macys Representative informed me, I was advised that as long as I made the payment of {$67.00}, before the next cycle date of the account, the account would not jeopardize, granted that the due date of the account was the XXXX of each month. Additionally, the Macys Representative listened to my concerns of my request, to pay the account after the due date of the XXXX, no later than the XXXX, but assured me, it would be fine. Since that was not the true case, and the account charged off, it is now my responsibility to continue payment on the account to the outside Collection Agency. Hence, this complaint correspondence, is in the way XXXX XXXX handled her conversation with me. Her tone was undeniably rude and frustrating. When we were in conversation, I did advise that I would also submit another complaint to the Better Business Bureau, for improper policies, simply put, not being fully honest with the expectation of the delinquent account. Again, for all the outreach that I did, in trying to receive assistance at the first occurrence of my delinquency, I was indisputably treated unfairly, with no care as to my outreach for assistance. I sent a thorough correspondence to the Macys Presidential Unit, and Macys CEO, dated on XXXX XXXX, 2017 in conjunction with submitting my complaint to the Better Business Bureau. In such, XXXX XXXX sent two correspondence. The first dated XXXX XXXX, 2017 and XXXX XXXX, 2017. Both correspondences were elaborately written in a word for word verbatim describing my account history. However, I think Macys and XXXX XXXX missed the point, I reached out in the first place, because my Family experienced a lost and my employment was reduced. All I asked for was for assistance. My correspondence submitted to the Macys Presidential Unit, to the Macys CEO and Better Business Bureau provided my distress and again my outreach for assistance. Also, distressing, was that in the first correspondence ( XXXX XXXX, 2017 ) that XXXX XXXX sent, she describes : However, our records show on XXXX XXXX, 2017, our Collections Department made XXXX attempts to call you at a phone number ending in XXXX, yet there was no answer, and we were unable to leave a message. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, you called and requested to update your billing phone number to the phone ending in XXXX. I explained to XXXX XXXX on our last verbal conversation, this is incorrect. My number has been for the life of this account, primary XXXX XXXXXXXX. It is my home number associated with my address that has been the same for over 15 years. This number is well documented for my Macys purchases where I made purchases on line, in addition, when I went into the store and a Representative would need to look up my account information for shopping transactions. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, I advised the Macys Representative of this record mistake, not to add a new number! Where is the validity of what I provided to the Representative in the Macys notes? Either XXXX XXXX is being dishonest or the Macys Representatives that take the calls or Macys as an entire entity is being dishonest. Nevertheless, XXXX XXXX felt it also necessary to send me a correspondence ( XXXX XXXX, 2017 ) along with another copy of ( Facts about Interest and Fees ) documentation ( I received this document in her first correspondence letter- XXXX XXXX, 2017 ) backing up her voicemail made on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. This action was, needless to say, pointless. Therefore, I am requesting that no further correspondence from Macys Representatives, Executive Offices or the like, nor phone calls to my residence occur, as of the date of this correspondence, today, Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. I will no longer entertain Macys direct correspondences, but will move forward to resolve through XXXX party affiliations, Better Business Bureau and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

He asked for my email, to which I replied US mail only please. He said \\\" so you want to play that game. '' Tried to talk over me and would not have a professional respectful conversation. I asked him to not call my home again. I told him he broke the law by sharing debt collection information with my sister. I told him as a third party collector he could not call my home everyday. He stated he was not a third party collector, he was with an Attorney Firm. He said \\\" You just blew it because your sister was going to pay this for you ; '' He lied. I told him I called the Ohio Attorney General 's office today to file a compliant. He stated the Attorney General could not do anything to him because they do n't know anything about his business and they had no jurisdiction over him. He told me my new husband was going to ruin my credit because in Ohio I was responsible for this debt even though it was before we were married. I told him to never call our home again. He refused to disclose verification of the debt. He made false statements. He threaten legal action. He refused to give me his address for written communication. He clearly made it known he was above the law and no respect or fear of violating it. I am taking this step because I am a reasonably smart business woman and he was able rattle me. He could easily scam or cause a weaker person dangerous physical stress. Here 's the bottom line. We have good credit. The debt is not reported on my husband 's credit bureau. If he owes it we would pay it but we are not going to give a random person any personal information over the phone.

The loan was current and in good-standing at the time. <P/>I entered a trial period with WFHM in XX/XX/XXXX. I made 2 of the 3 required trial period payments and when trying to make the 3rd payment I could not get through to my Home Preservation Specialist. I received a letter notifying me that I had been dropped from the program due to not meeting my trial period, even though it was NO fault of my own. I called and was told I would have to reapply. <P/>During the reapplication process, I received a letter of foreclosure on my door in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX ( which my XXXX year old son saw! ). I wrote letters to both the attorney listed AND WFHM Home Preservation department about the situation. I received a call back and was told that I DID N'T have to completely reapply and should have never been told that, that I just needed to ask to be reinstated in the program. After getting reinstated in the program, I have had nothing but runarounds on exactly which paperwork was needed and how it needed to be worded ( I had switched jobs during the application time and they needed verification of income ). I finally got entered into the trial period AGAIN. I have made all 3 trial period payments to-date and was approved for final modification. The start date would be XX/XX/XXXX with no payment due in XX/XX/XXXX. The paperwork for final signature was sent to me with my ex-husbands name, who has no stake in the property ( and was never on the original loan ). I called and reminded WFHM that I had a quitclaim and divorce decree and XXXX XXXX ' name needed off the paperwork. I faxed the quitclaim and divorce decree to WFHM immediately. I was told it would take a possible 150 MORE days to do a new title search. <P/>Through much trouble I was able to get WFHM to complete the title search in 48hrs.I NOW am being told that it will take ANOTHER 30 day or more to redraft the paperwork for me to sign. No one at the company, including the Executive Office AND the Office of the President, can manage to tell me what the new dates on my paperwork will be and if I owe a XX/XX/XXXX payment or not. <P/>This has caused a HUGE amount of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on me, as well as my XXXX year old son who has XXXX XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - who has unfortunately seen the letter of foreclosure and overheard phone calls to and from WFHM and constantly asks me if we 're going to lose our home and he 's going to have to move. This has also GREATLY affected my credit score because it 's been drug out so long with XXXX and is now being reported to the credit bureaus as significantly delinquent, as well as the amount being sent to HUD by WFHM ( that I will be responsible for upon end of loan term, pay-off, or sale of home ) has TRIPLED since they have drug this out so long. <P/>At this point, I still do n't know where things stand and no one at WFHM is able or willing to provide the information. <P/>I have phone records, email correspondence, mail correspondence, etc ... that can be provided as proof of my claims.\",\"It was explianed that I have open up an account witt his company and have had my phone sevices with another company for over 15 years.

They told me they did not. I was told to call back again in five or six days. I called back after the suggested wait period to find out the status of my payment.

However on XXXX XXXX I received notice that XX/XX/XXXX 's payment had not been made I immediately contacted Nation Stars customer service center to find out why they had not processed my XX/XX/XXXX payment. The response I got back was that we did not successfully complete the trail payment program to which I promptly stated that this was not accurate and produced the documentation to prove it. Nation star then informed me that they would begin an investigation and would contact me within 5 -10 business days with their findings, which they never return my repeated calls to them after the time limit for them to respond had expired. At that point I began to put the Mortgage Payments into escrow and informed them that I needed to know whether or not to send the payments to which they responded no because they would be placed in a hold until they completed their investigation. On XXXX XXXX I contacted Nation Star Mortgage again and inquired of them as to when there investigation would be done the receptionist on the line stated to me that there had not been and investigation initiated to which I responded that it should have begun XX/XX/XXXX and she stated again that there was no such investigation initiated. I the asked her to find out what happen and she said that after looking at the notes on her screen that there appears to be and inquiry of when you called and asked for the investigation by nothing was ever put in, to which she then stated that she would put the paperwork in. On XXXX XXXX I received an act XXXX stating that Nation Star Mortgage was initiating fore closer proceeding against me. I then went to see the people at American credit counseling agency and they informed me to file this compliant with you. I am hopeful that you can offer some assistance I currently still have in escrow three payments of {$820.00} totaling {$2400.00} and will continue to place my mortgage payments into this escrow.\",\"Received a call/voicemail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from what caller said was an attorneys office.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX were involved in this arrangement. Had Bank of America not agreed to this specialized pricing, we would not have moved our accounts. This agreement was not subject to any expiration date ; the only stipulation was that it was subject to review on an annual basis. For several years, XXXX XXXX came to our office annually to review the relationship ; no changes were ever proposed or made. Following XXXX XXXX 's departure from the bank, no further annual reviews occurred. However, the specialized pricing stayed in place as agreed. In XXXX, with no notice and no annual review, the bank began subjecting our accounts to more than double the agreed to fees in an effort to coerce us into signing unnecessary and unacceptable loan modification documents on our mortgage. We were specifically told by the local branch and the Business Banking office there was nothing they could do because the relationship was being managed by their Special Assets Group. At that point, the Special Assets Group refused to address the overcharges. After several months of inaction, I sent an email to the bank letting them know that this action was not only unethical, it was also illegal. Two business days after my email, the bank resumed the specialized pricing on our accounts. However, the bank refused to credit the overcharges it had previously imposed. A couple of months later, the bank increased the service fees again - with no notice and no annual review. When I brought this to their attention the Special Assets Group responded with a bogus default letter on our mortgage. At that point, I filed a complaint regarding both the mortgage and service fees with the Comptroller of the Currency. While most of the issues surrounding the mortgage seem to have been resolved, the problem with the excess service fees has not. It appears as though the OCC is unwilling to pursue the service fees ; seeing it as merely a contract dispute, instead of the clear case of fraud and coercion that it is. After refusing to address the problem for several months, XXXX XXXX with Bank of America finally responded to my roughly twelfth email to him on the subject to say that the bank considers the current service fees to be correct. This is ludicrous, as they are wholly inconsistent with our agreement. I have since sent the bank numerous emails requesting answers to questions such as, \\\" Who with Bank of America decided to change the charges on our accounts in a manner that is inconsistent with the specialized pricing agreement?

The end result is that after a fifty-five ( 55 ) day process of drip information requests by the second loan originator by phone ( the first loan originator was at a local BoA bank branch ( 1 hour of time collecting basic loan information ), my application was forwarded to underwriter loan processor, who informed me that she would n't approve my application. \\nMy complaint is based on the following : 1. The time taken just to ask questions and gather loan processor requested information - 55 days 2. The lack of clear and complete information requirements communicated in documentation provided to me via post mail, in multiple loan processor discussions during the loan origination process by the loan processor 3. The continued extension of time to gather a continued number of additional documents and requested information 4. The lack of clear communication along the process regarding my eligibility, or potential lack thereof 5. The communication received once the loan origination process was passed to loan underwriting 6. Updating my homeowner 's insurance policy was mandatory prior to underwriting review, which also added to the loan origination process time ; then, once underwriting declined, removal of this requirement from my homeowner 's policy 7. The first call from loan underwriter was to let me know that she had n't received my paperwork, and would I be willing to resubmit my paperwork ( after 55 days of submitting loan reference documentation to loan processing representative ) 8. After 55 days of loan processing requests and in my second conversation with mortgage loan underwriter, I was informed that the information I submitted along the process had n't been verified until the 55th day of the loan process. \\n9. I had to set-up a checking account with BoA, which was completed prior to underwriter review in order to receive a loan rate discount. \\n\\nThis loan process was a complete waste of my time and efforts in good faith to work with the BoA in information gathering and decision determination. The Bank should have known within 5 days of most of the information overall requested and provided whether I was qualified for this loan, and should have been able to verify any questions it had to determine my eligibility for the loan requested. \\n\\nI would like a complete review of this incident and process that was performed in order to show that the Bank was misleading in its communication and had no intention of offering me a loan at an earlier point in the loan process, but did not communicate it until nearly the end of the prolonged process and quoted time to process ( 60 days ). \\n\\nI can provide documentation as evidence that supports my complaint.\",\"I never contacted   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   of  XXXX , SC.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I had a wreck in my 2015 Toyota Corolla. Two weeks later forms were needed to complete the process for payment from XXXX. I had to go get an incident report, the breakdown on how XXXX insurance came up with that amount and the amount that was paid from my insurance. Okay this how it all got started. I went to Tennessee where the accident occurred and got the police report because I had all the other documents already to go. I put the documents in the mail the same day. I mailed the information XXXX. When I mailed it off I made sure that the company gets it in a couple of days. Okay I thought the process had begun until I check my credit report and I showed thirty day delinquent. So I called XXXX and asked them why have n't XXXX Toyota received the remaining balance yet from the 2015 XXXX XXXX. They stated that all the information has not been received to get the ball rolling. So I asked what other information that you are talking about. XXXX stated we are still waiting on the police report. I told them I sent it out already. We went back and forth with the same conversation. I told them I paid XXXX dollars for that incident report. I am glad I made a copy of the XXXX I had. So I sent another report out to them. I kept checking every week to see had the process begin. Still no word on when they will pay the remaining balance. So I asked do I need to pay my regular car payment so it will not go on my credit. The worker stated your case is being processed just waiting on the incident report. By that time another thirty days was approaching on my credit report. I just sit there with tears in my eyes because I knew it was nothing I could do because one thirty days had already smashed my good standing credit. I have worked so hard trying to do the right thing with my credit just for this company to give me the run around on finishing paying for the car. When you add extra coverage on your vehicle to make sure it is paid in full just in case something happen, it really happens. XXXX did n't waste any time receiving their portion of the payment every month. But when push comes to shove, they let you down. This is really upsetting to me because I pay my bills and for this to happen it is heartbreaking after I worked so hard to keep my credit in good standing. I have always paid my bills on time and XXXX acts as if credit does n't matters to them. I did have no problem paying them every month. So when I became in need, they washed me under the table. This is my first time dealing with XXXX. They did n't explain to me how the process works if an accident occur.

He alerted me that he made a purchase but was unsure what account it was linked. This alerted me to check my account and I was alarmed that it was overdraft by approximately {$650.00}, so I panicked and transferred from our savings account to ensure nothing else would overdraft causing more fees. I checked my account yesterday and was flabbergasted to see that I was negative approximately {$350.00}. So I did some further investigating on my account and noticed that I was getting an overdraft fee for small items as low as XXXX cents and in the month of XXXX alone I was charged about {$1000.00} in overdraft fees. At this point I called the Wells Fargo Customer Service line and spoke with a very kind representative and she said she could only refund me {$260.00} ( give or take. ) I told her that I completely understood her position but that it would not be wise for me to settle when that would still leave my account overdraft and vulnerable to more charges. She completely understood and then transferred me to another representative with more authority. Again, I was treated very professionally and with kindness. Unfortunately she said she would only be able to refund my account around {$650.00}. Please excuse the estimations as I am going by memory. I told her that was a better amount but that I felt that I had been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and the new overdraft policies that she said I had opted in? I did further investigating on my account and am so sick right now looking at the fees charged so far this year. They total over {$3000.00}. This was money that could have been used to keep my mortgage current, my student loans current and my credit cards current, but now I am in such a hole that I ca n't see the light. \\n\\nI believe there was a lot of charges accrued due to the way Wells Fargo drafted items out of my account.

I could not understand why they would be calling since I have automatic withdrawal from my account bimonthly. I was unable to discuss the situation then being that I was in a grocery store. When I called back I found out that XXXX of my bimonthly payments was being applied entirely to the principal and that I was getting late fees because naturally the required monthly mortgage payment was not being received. My mortgage was with Greentree when I initiated the bimonthly payment. I was told that Ditech acquired the mortgage and that everything would remain the same with Ditech as it did with Greentree. That is not the case. When I initiated the bimonthly payment with Greentree, it was not the amount that Ditech started to withdraw from my bank account. When I called and asked about this I was told that loots of things happen when mortgages are purchased. I now am watching to see if the late fees ( more that one month ) and the payment is being applied to the mortgage and not the principal. I also learned that although I have the first of the bimonthly payments taken out of my bank account, it is NOT applied to my mortgage. As stated on my statement, the money is listed as \\\" funds in suspense ''. I thought the payment was being applied to the mortgage not being held until the balance for the month is received and applied. So the first half of the payment is taken from my account and held \\\" in suspense '' in an account at Ditech where I am certain it is earning them interest yet it is not applied to my mortgage whereby lowering the interest accruing on the mortgage. Can they really do that? Also, they now say I can have the PMI removed, however they are requiring me to have an appraisal with XXXX of their vendors to qualify to remove the PMI. I though PMI was to insure that they would receive payment not to insure the value of the home. Why am I being made to prove the value of the home to get rid of an insurance payment?\",\"My loan was in deferment/forebearance and XXXX reported it as late for several months when I contacted them they said they were going to remove the incorrect information and it still remains.

In connection with this credit reporting, I have been unsuccessfully trying to get Experian to correct erroneous data in my file or to delete the account entirely from my credit report. I have made these disputes numerous times for more than 60 days now. Initially, I was patient with the disputing and re-disputing. I commenced the initial dispute around  XX/XX/XXXX . At least 3 times previously to this complaint, I had the opportunity to file numerous disputes because the re-investigation terminated before 30 days, which created an opportunity for me to introduce subsequent disputes. With each re-investigation of the dispute, it becomes more frustrating because the erroneous information either remains, or it gets worse. My bankruptcy has been  discharged for more than a couple of years now. For me to refinance my home, it has to correctly reflect the discharge date. Lenders are requiring a two-year discharge of a bankruptcy prior to consideration of an application to refinance. Although the bankruptcy has been discharged, Experian is still showing that it is OPEN, a nd that erroneous reporting is hurtful. I have disputed this status and requested that the date of the discharge is accurately reporting. In the dispute of the  XXXX   County Federal Tax Lien,  I disputed that the tax lien was reporting as UNPAID, and it had not been released. This lien was included in the bankruptcy filed in  XX/XX/XXXX . Moreover, the lien was both paid and released through the bankruptcy. There were  XXXX  of these reporting on my credit report :  XXXX  that were recording in  XXXX  County and the exact same  XXXX  were recorded in  XXXX  County.  XXXX  have been deleted -- - the  XXXX  in  XXXX  County and the  XXXX  in  XXXX  County. I disputed with Experian the discrepancy. If the  XXXX  for  XXXX  County were deleted, the same should have been delete for  XXXX  County ; however, all but  XXXX  was deleted from  XXXX  County. As a consequence of the re-investigation, now, Experian is reporting that the lien was filed and released in  XX/XX/XXXX  ... On th e SAME Day. Th is causes the item to remain on my credit report until  XX/XX/XXXX , although it was initially filed in  XX/XX/XXXX  and included in the bankruptcy in  XX/XX/XXXX . The fact that it was included in the bankruptcy is reason enough to delete it. I was appalled because Experian is not doing their job. How can a lien be filed, paid, and released on the same day?! It does not make sense! The reporting agency has a responsibility to use good judgement instead of automatically slapping nonsense onto a credit report, as if they were a robot. In the dispute of Experian 's reporting of  XXXX   XXXX , I have informed Experian that this account was a part of a bankruptcy that was filed in  XXXX  of  XXXX . More than seven years later, it is still reporting negatively on my credit report. I have been unsuccessfully trying to get them to remove the account because the time has expired for its reporting. Finally, I uploaded to Experian personal information concerning my bankruptcy to prove that  XXXX  was included, and it should be removed. In addition, I had to sue  XXXX  to force them to comply with  Dodd-Frank and grant me a fair loan modification, which was settled through mediation. It took   many attempts to even get Experian to verify that the account was paid off. However, it is still reporting after 7 years of being a part of the bankruptcy. Each time I disputed, I have had to correct subsequent erroneous information that surfaced as a result of the re-investigation.  XXXX   XXXX  was included in a bankruptcy as  XXXX , which  XXXX  acquired from them after the bankruptcy. This account should be deleted. The fact that it was included in the lawsuit that I reported to  XXXX  makes it a civil matter. To continue to report it, even after that, places Experian in the position of taking sides. When this became a civil matter and was settled throug h the courts, Experian should not be reporting the credit line. There was a Temporary Restraining Order and a Temporary I njunction that ordered  XXXX  to cease and desist. This information was reported to Experian to no avail. In the case of  XXXX   XXXX , I have never paid this account late. I requested that Experian removes the negative data, but keep the trade line. My payment left me in time, and it was not returned to me. When I notified  XXXX   XXXX  that the payment was made, but not negotiated, I paid them again. I have never carried a balance on this account. I have always paid them in full each month. If the payment was not received, I immediately paid them. In the case of  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , I was never given an opportunity to dispute this debt. When I discovered that it was reporting negatively in my file, I contacted them to ascertain the nature of the debt. I discovered that these charges were slammed on me after I paid for a service. I was being charged for a service that I did not receive. I explained this to Experian and  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . Since that time, I received a letter from  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  informing me that they were suspending collection and passing my dispute to the provider of the service ; however, in spite of this admission, Experian is still reporting this negatively on my credit report. The  XXXX  reporting agencies have a duty to keep information reporting accurately in an individual 's credit file. Sometimes, I feel as though they slant on the side of the creditor by the way their re-investigation is conducted. Everyone, who submits a dispute, is not trying to cheat on their credit report. I suffered an ordeal that forced me into bankruptcy as a consequence of the mortgage meltdown that destroyed many business owners of the construction industry. I have weathered that storm ; however, when Experian is cavalier in its methods of re-investigation of the erroneous data they warehouse, it adds salt to an open wound that is trying to heal and close.\",\"I have a home that I purchased with an XXXX loan ( 80 % being owned by XXXX XXXX and 20 % being owned by Bank of America ). In XXXX of XXXX, I lost my job and had to relocate states for a new job. I put my home on the market in XXXX of XXXX and have had it actively listed through XXXX XXXX. \\nThroughout this entire process, the home was n't getting any offers ( after over XXXX showings ) so I took a short sale offer in XXXX of XXXX ( which is also the last time I paid my mortage ). XXXX XXXX approved all paperwork for the short sale within XXXX weeks of getting the offer. With that approval, my agent and I could then start the Bank of America approval process ( submitted around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), which I was told by BOA representatives, would be quick and easy as this is a XXXX mortgage and they would follow the primary lien holder. \\nThroughout the Bank of America process, I was repeatedly handed off to new Account Managers that were handling my mortgage process. Every time I had called them and left voicemails, I NEVER ONCE received a return phone call ( my agent, on the other hand, did receive a few calls, but it was never consistent ). I called the customer service line to follow up on the status of my offer at least every other day ( which they noted all the while in my call log ). I was given multiple 'closing dates ' but as each one neared, they claimed they were missing some sort of documentation ( although my agent and I spent many hours uploading the same documents over and over through their systems ). This took us all the way to XXXX and when this was finally approved by Bank of America ( closing date was slated for XX/XX/XXXX ... ..XXXX full months after initiated ) - the pipes in my home had frozen and burst, causing extensive damage and the buyer backed out. \\nCurrently, I have another offer on the table, again XXXX XXXX quickly approved ( this time within XXXX weeks ) and now again, I am waiting on Bank of America to approve the short sale. This time, though, they had already 'charged off ' my account ( which I was never given any notice ) so I had to have a special team handle my account ( I could never reach any customer service reps on the phone to discuss what to do ). Now that they are reviewing all of the documents, they are asking for very basic information ( all of which had previously been uploaded into their systems ) ; items that have been legally recorded in the County Auditor 's website, they are asking me to verify if that is indeed truly Ohio 's law ( really? could something be recorded by the County Auditor as a public record, filed my an attorney, be under Ohio Law )? I have provided all necessary documentation and again, still can not get a straight answer, whether it be via phone call or email. \\nIf this does not go through, I will be forced to foreclose on the home and truly, I feel as though this would have been completed months ago had this been handled professionally and on time. I have always been MORE than accomodating, spending hours of my time on the phone ( which they have said to me they could see in their call logs ), only to get different answers from each different person that has touched my account. Again, if I have had an approval on this short sale previously, using the same documents, why is it not being approved again? Yet the offer to BOA is still exactly the same as the previous offer? I truly feel that this has been extremely disheartening, not to mention so incredibly frustrating. I 'm really hopeful that something can be done so other people do n't have to go through something like this! \\nIt 's very frustrating that for 9 years, I had always paid my mortgage early/on time, yet can not get any sense of closure on something that was certainly out of my control.\",\"I was alarmed when \\\" Late Payment '' notifications began appearing on my XXXX Credit Report in XXXX 2016.

We also feel obligated to advise you that, in the event a judgment is awarded in our client 's favor, our client would look for evidence that would pierce your corporate entity veil, and enter litigation against you personally and all other potential principals, successors and affiliates. In doing so, our client would look at the comingling of the business assets with those of the individual principals. Additionally, our client would examine the reality of the corporate existence as evidenced by the keeping of minutes and other corporate records. Our client would explore the possibility of an obvious inadequacy of working capital, and would also determine the number of non-functioning officers and/or directors. The possibility of non-payments of dividends would be investigated, possibly coupled with payment of substantial salaries or other forms of payments to dominant shareholders. Our client would also look at all of your expenses to determine if your business was paying your personal expenses, such as excessive meals, travel, cell phone bills and automobile expenses and the legitimacy of employment of family members. Our client will seek Attorneys ' Fees against you for having to engage in any post judgment proceedings. \\n\\nIn the event a judgment is entered against you, our client will engage in every method of post judgment remedies to recover the amounts owed. This will include, but not be limited to, the freezing of accounts, debtor examinations, levying against your real and personal property, and filing citations against any and all parties you transact business with. Our client will trace funds and if our client finds that you have transferred assets in violation of Fraudulent Conveyances Act, it will seek to have these assets re-conveyed to you and sold to satisfy the judgment. If you are directly involved in another business which is not in your name, our client will investigate the business thoroughly and seek to have the business re-titles in your name and sold to satisfy the judgment. Our client will record a Memorandum of Judgment against you and it will negatively affect your credit, making it more expensive and difficult for you to borrow money. \\n\\nI perceive this has a direct threat without the company knowing what issues we have had with XXXX.

It appears that PHH 's lack of participation in a meaningful modification review of the file indicates a preference to profit directly from the homeowners hardships. Furthermore, the numerous times the homeowner has spoken to the PHH should extinguish any opportunity to excuse PHH 's behavior. \\nAt this time we are demanding a postponement of the sale date or the homeowners will assert their legal right and name PHH and XXXX XXXX as defendants in Civil Court.\",\"On XXXX XXXX, 2014 my husband, XXXX left a dentist extremely dissatisfied. He immediately contacted American Express to stop payment of {$7500.00} and to initiate a dispute. On XXXX XXXX, 2014 my husband unexpectedly passed away. In uttergrief I contacted American Express on XXXX XXXX to get our miles to fly our family to the services and told them of his passing. On XXXX XXXX the {$7500.00} appeared on my acct. At no time and in no way at all did American Express tell me that there was an active dispute on my husband 's acct. If they had I would have immediately turned the matter over to my husband 's estate attorney. I have provided documentation of the charge, a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 from my husband to Am Ex, a letter of AmEx 's terms and a letter from the XXXX involved showing the date of XXXX/XXXX/2014 the day he was faxing a response to American Express. I have been trying to deal on my own with this. Every time a rep says a supervisor will look into it and call back. They never do. I can not tell you how distressing this has been. We have been AmEx customers for XXXX years. I was told if I wanted a copy of the recorded conversation from XXXX XXXX, 2014 that it must be by subpoena only. I never agreed to accept this responsibility. American Express failed to disclose the active dispute which should have gone to the estate attorney.\",\"I was frequently solicited by mail from One Main Financial. The advertisement 's were usually offering same day loans of {$10000.00}. I would take  XXXX  loans from them from and pay them off immediately as the interest rates are in the are of 27-29 %. The third loan I took from the company was in 2013 and would be for {$5000.00}. I paid   XXXX   XXXX   of the {$5000.00} immediately and this covered my monthly payments from  XXXX  to  XXXX . In  XXXX  I would go a few days without phone service after my cell phone broke. My loan was not even a month past due and One Main representatives called my Mother, Uncle and my job and discussed the debt in detail with my relatives. This being a direct assault on my privacy rights as a consumer I phoned them and told them they what they had done and responded by telling me I have done this to myself. I refused to pay after this violation of my rights and personal damage done to my personal relationships and One Main is attempting to sue me for the amount past due plus {$460.00} in interest. These predatory lenders are unjust in their practices and in complete violation of The Fair Debt Collection Practices. I previously worked as a collection agent and am appalled at their tactics and would never discuss a debt to someone other than the debtor much less for a payment less than three months past due.\",\"Was harassed into closing my American Express Card. Several weeks before XXXX switched from American Express to XXXX, Amex sent me a letter stating that I had two weeks to contact them or my account would be closed. Upon contacting them they requested a XXXX form. I filled out and returned said form as they requested and they put a hold on my card. Two weeks later on XXXX XXXX they called again and said that the form I sent them was illegible and they needed me to fill out the info again and resend it. I asked what the point was in me doing that if it took two weeks to process with the change over to XXXX was less than that. I once again got hit with the if you do n't comply we 'll cancel the card. At this point I was infuriated, I said if that 's what we need to do so be it. They then cancelled my card thus forfeiting my Rewards and smooth transition over to XXXX. I feel without the harassment and badgering by their staff I would 've never cancelled the card but the constant threat of getting my card cancelled when I tried my best to initially comply was too much for me to endear.\",\"I applied for a credit card to purchase an XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I have made payments towards the card, just recently, I was charged accrued interest. This interest is causing financial hardship. My intention was to pay the card off within the alloted time, however, financial hardship prohibited me from doing this. My brother XXXX in 2012 and as a result, our family is sustaining financial hardship. My mother is attempting to remain afloat but the loss of his income has now had an impact on my mothers finances. All savings have been depleted. As a result, I have had to contribute financial support to my mom in order to meet everyday expenses. I have only XXXX credit card and this is with Barclay. I am hoping that Barclay will note that I have made the payments as required and when I have the ability, I pay more than the minimum payment. I would like to continue to maintain my credit card with Barclay and look forward to expanding a financial relationship with them. I am only XXXX years old, but due to the XXXX brother have now had to take on added responsiblities. Any compassion on the part of Barclays would be met with very much gratitude. I honestly did not know that the interest was going to be added or I would have made bigger attempts to pay a larger dollar payment. Thank you again for your understanding of my financial hardship.\",\"Dear XXXX XXXX ( CEO of Ally Bank ), If you happen to read this comment, I want you to know that your customer service/retention is awful. My husband and I over nighted several checks written and signed to both of us and instead of depositing them into my account, a representative of your company gave us the run around and ultimately referred to your companies policy to deny a deposit for any reason. XXXX, what is the point of having an online bank if I also have to have an account with a brick and mortar bank to have checks deposited? I now have to wait on snail mail ( during the busy holiday season ) to receive our checks back and then open a brick and mortar bank account just to receive OUR money from these checks.

On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I saw a charge for {$130.00} to XXXX XXXX in XXXX ( I live in XXXX and have not been to XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX ). I called the number to XXXX and the recording said if I had a billing issue to send an email with my personal information and last XXXX digits of my credit card number. I decided to call the credit card company ( Citibank ) and have them remove the charge from what seemed like a bogus company. They said I needed to submit a dispute online, so I did and they issued a conditional credit for the {$130.00}. Over the next day or so I started thinking about it and realized that someone had my card and the representative at Citi did n't shut my card off. I called back and asked if they were sending me a new card and they said they could if I wanted them to but they do n't do that without request. I explained that my card was used on the other side of the United States for chicken and waffles, since I did not make this purchase someone has my card number I want it cancelled. They seemed surprised by this but sent out another card. On XXXX XXXX I received a response from Citbank with a copy of chargeback evidence from XXXX saying that a XXXX XXXX with an address in XXXX and an email address of XXXXXXXXXXXX ( not even close to my email or address ) ordered this and paid with my credit card number ( no signature, no actual card ) and I am responsible for this charge. I am livid at the customer service from this credit card company. I had to call them to dispute it again, sign a form and mail it ( using my stamp ) but they still have the charge on my card. I received a response yesterday saying that they have sent my response to XXXX and they will get back to me by XX/XX/XXXX!! My bill is due in XX/XX/XXXX, I will not pay for a stolen credit card charge when I alerted them the day of the charge. This is a platinum card that is supposed to have protection on it but it has n't protected me at all. I want the {$130.00} taken off of my card without me having to jump through hoops.

Additionally, Nordstrom closed my dispute without properly addressing the facts of my claim.     In response to Nordstrom 's  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  reply to my original claim : Re-stating the facts, my account was first reported as delinquent in  XXXX   XXXX . Nordstrom claims that \\\" Payments were then made bringing the account current, however, due to a lack of payment the account charged off in  XXXX   XXXX  ''. What they fail to understand is that the  XXXX   XXXX  date is the date in which my account was Paid in full, NOT the date in which my account was first reported as \\\" charged off '' which is what Nordstrom is reporting. ( Please see screenshot from my credit report  )  When I began my payment arrangements, I authorized Nordstrom to deduct my account the same amount until the account was paid in full. 6 months later, I received a call for a missed payment! What the customer service representative failed to mention when initially setting me up on auto payment is that I would have to initiate another authorization of deduction after 6 months of payments. I reinstated the automatic deduction and to explain to the customer service representative that no one informed me of this policy. I was misled by the representative who initially set me up on my first attempt for payment arrangement.     Not only is  Nordstrom reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus regarding the date of first delinquency, they have misled me and did not inform  me of crucial information regarding my account. Again, the customer service representative who set me up on my initial automatic payment arrangement did NOT notify me of a 6 month maximum policy.

Subsequently, I spoke with a UHEAA representative who confirmed that my loans had been transferred to their company and was given a new account UHEAA number. I indicated that I needed the 2016 IBR application in order to file on a timely basis. I was told that they would mail it out to me. Unfortunately, I learned later that my local Post Office returned my UHEAA IBR application mailed to my Post Office Box to them as \\\" Addressee Unknown '' even though it was addressed correctly and that is my postal address. When I did not receive the IBR application from UHEAA within a \\\" reasonable '' timeframe, I called them up to ask what happened. It was only then that I learned that my local Post Office had returned the IBR to UHEAA. At that point I asked to speak to a supervisor and requested that I receive a copy of the officially postmarked \\\" Addressee Unknown. '' My plan was to take that paperwork into my local Post Office and meet with the Station Manager. I was unable to do that because when I received the \\\" promised '' paperwork from UHEAA, it did not contain the \\\" Addressee Unknown '' documentary evidence I was seeking ; although it did contain the 2016 IBR application. Upon receipt, I called UHEA and asked to speak to a supervisor who then explained to me that their system does not save the actual returned mail - it 's simply scanned into their system as \\\" Returned to Sender - Addressee Unknown. '' At this point I was anxious to complete my IBR application and send it in.

Subsequently, I received notification that my IBR application was under review, however, the next letter I received from UHEAA indicated that they could not approve my IBR until they received further information. At that point I called UHEAA and spoke to a supervisor again since it was not clear to me what the delay was about. The supervisor indicated that UHEAA wanted more specific documentation of my income. I immediately complied with their request which included sending a copy of a recent paystub for my wife. Then when I did not hear anything back from UHEAA, I called them up but was unable to reach them on the phone. This was during a two week period XX/XX/XXXX into XX/XX/XXXX. At the time I chalked the paperwork delay up to it being close to the XXXX holiday period. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case : in XXXX when I could not get through on the phone to a UHEAA representative, I went to their social media pages and saw that on XXXX and XXXX it said that the company was experiencing a \\\" business interruption.

Cutting to the chase : UHEAA sent me a letter denying my IBR request indicating that they could not determine my income. This is despite the fact that my 2016 IBR paperwork was immediately approved by XXXX other lenders. Importantly, that IBR paperwork was approved with LESS information than what I provided UHEAA. At this point I feel that UHEAA is operating in an unethical manner and is not in compliance with the standard IBR approval process.

They have ignored this evidence and then last i called they told me i have 2 hours to submit the receipts from the store or my case will be closed forever without possibility to reopen it again..

I would like the XXXX American Express accounts that are currently showing balances removed from my credit report\",\"Continuation of previous complaint : Go Financial has sent correspondence to my disputes and complaints with the credit bureaus, BBB, and CFPB. The information they sent continues to show proof of several violations and discrepancies with this invalidated debt. Go Financial states on the Redemption and reinstate form that the vehicle was repossessed on XX/XX/16, however they state on another document that it was repossessed on XX/XX/16. The notice that they are required to send me per NC law about the sell of the vehicle is dated XX/XX/16 and XX/XX/16 on another document. This notice was never received by me which suggests that it was possibly forged to serve this purpose. Per NC law they are required to notify me of the date, time and place of the sell of the vehicle if it was sold at an auction. Their letter states that I was notified that the vehicle will be sold at anytime within 10 days of the letter at a private sale, but continues to read that it was actually sold at an auction in which they never notified me of the date, time, or location -- the location on their documents only notify me of where the vehicle was being stored. Their failure to provide this information conflicts with NC State Law which decides what a creditor can and cant do. ( NCGS ) On the explanation of deficiency they lists that I owe XXXX without fees, but they are reporting a different amount on my credit report which they have never sent me a breakdown reflecting the new charges. I find this company to be in violation of my rights under the FCRA. They have failed at providing me with accurate, clear, or validated information. Even with so many discrepancies they continue to report as accurate on my credit reports after investigation. With so many discrepancies directly from them, there is no way to validate what is accurate. They have also violated the laws of NC by being unable to provide any receipts or verifiable information that they notified me specifically about the sale of the vehicle to provide me with an opportunity to attend the sale.\",\"my company is apart of my bankruptcy case who was served with notification of the bankruptcy from Federal District Court as of 2013.

I tried placing the order, but the website kept saying that my card was declined. I knew this must be a mistake as I have not missed any payments and have a {$0.00} balance. I called the customer service number that displayed, and was informed my card had been deactivated for not having been used in awhile. I was surprised to find that this occurred without any notice to me! She stated she could have it reactivated, and I asked her to do so. However, she came back on the line and informed me that due to a system upgrade, I could not use my credit card until this coming Tuesday. I was taken aback that such a mature company as Macys would take several days for a system upgrade! In this day and age, there should be no reason that a customer 's credit account would have to be deactivated for such a long period due to a technology update. ESPECIALLY without notice to the customer. \\nHowever, I understand that such things are beyond my or the agent 's control, so I simply asked her to guarantee that when I place the order on Tuesday I will be granted the same sale price and 15 % off offer that I would receive today if the order were placed. She could not promise me this and said I would lose the pricing. With the current sale and promotion, I would be saving over {$600.00}! It is unacceptable that I would lose this price due to a system update and no fault of my own. \\nI then asked to speak to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for 10 minutes, and ultimately the call was answered by another agent who was not a supervisor. She had to transfer me to XXXX, a supervisor with ID number XXXX, who could not help me. She kept talking over me and acting as if I were unreasonable in my simple request to have her guarantee the pricing. When she said she could not promise this, I asked to speak to someone above her. She said there is no one above her that I can talk to. She also said she can not make any notes in my file because my order is not yet placed. Again, this is absurd considering I have been a Macy 's customer and credit account holder for many years. I can not believe that not only did XXXX not have a supervisor I could speak to, but that in this day and age, Macys does not have the technology for her to notate my account. \\nI would like to mention that the reason my account was XXXX was because I rarely ever shop at Macy 's anymore. The reason is that I have been displeased with the service and find XXXX to be a much better company. However, I was intrigued by the sale on the bedding items, and decided to give it another chance. It seems that this may have been a mistake.\",\"My loans are consolidated with Navient.

Im XXXX with a XXXX, and unfortunately I have XXXX. Because of this I occasionally make purchases that my relatively small bank account might not have the funds for. After getting nailed with ridiculous XXXX dollar overdraft fees I called in and talked to a BoA rep. I had them go into my bank settings, and set it up supposedly so I could not make purchases unless I had enough money to make them, which is what I thought a debit card was supposed to do in the first place. After that though it still happened, despite what the BoA reps told me, I called a total of three different times about this same issue over the years to \\\" fix '' it, and still I get nailed now and then from the fees. I admit my bad memory problem, but when Im told one thing three times and yet another thing keeps happening its ridiculous. This fourth time I just called in and talked to yet another BoA rep. I asked her how a certain transaction was allowed to go through when I didnt have enough funds, which of course triggered a XXXX dollar fee. She couldnt exactly give me that answer. She kept saying its how my account was set up, even though I told her three different times I called BoA and was told it they changed the settings to prevent this. If I didnt have the funds, the transaction should have never went through, and the fee would have never happened. She said it was a transaction declined fee, yet the transaction was NOT declined the purchase went through fully on my end.

When I tried making my XXXX XXXX payment it showed I owed {$0.00}. I contacted XXXX and they stated my loan was transferred to a new lender and that I would be receiving letters in the mail with details. The only letter I received was on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from FirstMark Services ( my new servicer ) stating that I was behind on payments from missing the XXXX XXXX payment. I emailed FirstMark Services on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to get more information regarding the situation. I did n't even know who my new servicer was to make a payment. XXXX replied on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX apologizing and that they would look into a forbearance option to catch me up on payments and get back to me. They finally called me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In between those dates, my co-signer and I continued to receive harassing phone calls. As I spoke to the gentleman he informed me that they were ready to begin applying for a forbearance but I would have to verbally apply first. I thought this whole time they were already processing the forbearance due to their mistake. I completed the verbal application and the man informed me that there is a good chance that I would be approved. However, I had to first fill out the application and send it into FirstMark. I tried re-explaining my entire situation because I do n't think they fully understood. But all FirstMark kept stating was that it did n't matter if I never received information I was still responsible to repay my loan because I signed the Promissory Note. I completely understand this but I did n't know who to send my payment to. The representative stated next that it would take some time for them to gather the forms and mail them to me. And if they did n't process it by the XXXX of XXXX that it would be reported on my credit. I asked if there was any options to expedite me receiving the application to avoid this, maybe if I could get the form myself online or if he could email me the forms. He stated that he would email the forms to me and I would be able to receive it within 2 days using this option. This helped ease my mind a bit. Unfortunately, as I am writing this today it is XXXX XXXX and I have not received any emails or letters with the forms I need. This means this entire error they have made will now penalize my credit. FirstMark Services just seems to be playing games and not willing to assist in anyway. I made payments for 8 straight years with XXXX never missing XXXX from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Now, under FirstMark things have fallen apart.\",\"I was trying to make a high ticket purchase and was advised that I have a judgement from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I closed a XXXX XXXX account I had back in XXXX. To my knowledge it was in good standing. I used the checks from that to pay my rent. After moving from NJ in XXXX I have been in contact with my previous landlord and the last check I wrote them for my last month of rent went through fine. Since I no longer live in NJ I never received the correspondence from the court regarding that lawsuit when it was sent out. I contacted the courts and was provided copies of the documents that were submitted. In these documents there is nothing showing how the account became overdrawn or delinquent. I was expecting a statement of some sort from the bank showing the fees but there is n't one. I did not receive a call from the bank to notify me that the account was overdrawn or a letter. To my knowledge the collection agency, Retail Recovery Svc NJ Inc, did not contact me either. My phone number has been the same for many years. on XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX customer service. They were not able to pull up the account. I was transferred to the collections department and they were not able to view the account. I spoke to someone in the department where XXXX accounts are handled and they could not pull up the account. Eventually, I called the executive office and was transferred to someone 's voicemail. I left a message and have not heard back from her yet. My main concern is that all of this may be due to fraudulent activity. I feel like I am being forced to pay for something without solid documentation. I contacted the attorney and the only thing he wants is money. At first I was going to just go ahead and pay the attorney {$1000.00} but that 's a lot of money to pay out and not know what is going on. How do I know if this is n't due to the fraud that took place at XXXX XXXX?\",\"Even after my initial complaint filing, I am still being wrongfully treated by Wells Fargo. For the past several months they have nothing but to make me jump through hoops, and even with my initial complain filing they still asked for the same documents over and over again and what 's the point of my relationship manager. I 've only spoken with XXXX XXXX a handful of times, and do n't recall anytime where he actually answered the phone, so I had to speak with several other people who, and again, as always had a different version of events, told me different things are needed, and gave me different advice. It 's like they are only going through the motions, and after months and months of more run-a-round, they declined my request for mortgage assistance because they claim my house was vacant!? This is 100 % false and impossible because at the time there was a Tenant in the property who was paying {$4000.00} per month. No one pays {$4000.00} per month and not live in a property. Wells Fargo knew this because they received copies of the rent check several times ... because they asked for it several times. This unfair denial caused the Tenant to become unformfotable and he vacated the property, causing me to move back into the property as my primary residence, and as required I inform Wells Fargo of any change of circumstances, ... and they did nothing but deny me! Are n't they supposed to work with me? Additionally, in the denial my income was calculated wrong. I brought both of these issues up to XXXX XXXX, who did n't care one bit. I was provided a 20 day appeal period and I appealed their decision and it was denied the same day! and when I ask why?, they will not provide me with a reason. XXXX XXXX just told me that it would take 5 days to close out the file and to re-applyI waited 5 days and reapplied. But the file was n't still closed internally. Apparenlty someone else needed to push a button to close the file, and it was n't until around XX/XX/2016 that someone finally pushed the button. My file was routed to the Wells Fargo reentry team, I was put on hold for about 20 minutes and when she came back, I was asked to send in items to prove my occupancy, and I did just that, and again ... it took them less than a day to deny me. This time I 'm denied because my loan is almost 3 years delinquent. Since when was this a provision of HAMP?, and it seems rather convenient that days before the HAMP deadline that Wells Fargo comes up with yet another excuse to give me the run-a-round. Clearly, they are just taking advantage of the expiring HAMP program to stick it to the homeowner once again!\",\"I was XXXX in XXXX outside of an ATM in the XXXX on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. My watch, phone and debit card were stolen from me. When I returned to my hotel room I called the police and my wife. My wife attempted to call Chase immediately that night because I was in bad physical shape after the XXXX and I was talking to the police. She told Chase that the debit card needed to be cancelled because it had been stolen outside of an ATM and they would not allow her to cancel the card even though it is a joint account because she was not me. After seeing a doctor and finishing with the police I got on the first plane I could back to XXXX where we live. Once I returned to XXXX I went to the XXXX and returned home to get some rest and recover. When we woke up the next morning, we had received several notifications that transactions had been approved on our debit card and that our savings and checking amounts had been severely depleted. We immediately went to a Chase branch to address the issue, provided forms of our ID 's and started the claim process. They assured us all funds would be returned in 12 hours, and that the card had been cancelled and there was no reason to close or freeze our accounts. Subsequently we received several emails stating the claims had been cancelled due to a conversation Chase had, had with me over the phone. This was not me calling, the only identifying information they requested in the claims and/or fraud department was the card number and PIN which they knew the criminals had after several conversations we had with them. Since the initial call from my wife and since the first time we cancelled the card and received assurance that the card could NOT be reactivated, and several visits to Chase ourselves, Chase has reactivated the card twice over the phone with a fraudulent caller and cancelled the claims 3 times allowing the criminals to continue to compromise and spend our money. How this is even possible I do not know. We have requested several times that any changes or request for information on our accounts had to be made in person with ID 's and calls needed additional identification like our security questions and as much personal information possible in order to take any action or hold any conversations. As of this morning, we received notification that our claims are being denied again and we need to go to the Chase branch again. We still do not have any resolution to these claims and transactions that continue to take place in XXXX when we are in XXXX and have been since Monday. This has required us to miss several days of work trying to resolve and if it does not get resolved will force us into delinquency on our mortgage, our child 's school payments, credit cards and basic everyday living expenses. Chase 's lack of controls or care in confirming our identity including lack of action when my wife called and several other issues along the way. It seems outrageous that to cancel the the card by a joint holder of the account would be much harder than reactivating a card that had been claimed as stolen over the phone more than once. This was our life savings and we have zero control what is happening in a different state with our money and ca n't seem to find anyone who can help which has caused us now to have to find a way to borrow money to find an attorney to resolve this issue with Chase.\",\"Unauthorized inquiry and/or unknown company\",\"PNC LN XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX We have submitted our authorization and a complete short sale package to PNC.

PNC has never contacted the homeowner, has never attempted to do any kind of workout option with her, and this is violation of State and Federal Law. <P/>Since the homeowner is XXXX years old, PNCs lack of legally required communication also raises questions of Elder Abuse.

I feel like I am being taken advantage of.\",\"This is a serious problem~ regarding Bank of America 's Faulty & Misleading Accounting System across the board for all my 3 checking accounts with this bank, when using my Debit Card linked to any of my given BOA checking bank accounts. Here is the problem : When I use any of my debit cards to pay for a transaction, and the charge is, of course, immediately placed against my respective bank checking account to which it is linked, there is NO transaction number that Bank of America assigns to that transaction! SO I ca n't keep track of it! ~ or ANY of my transactions, so that I never know what my day-to-day ACCURATE balance really is in my accounts. What often happens is that even though the merchant has not actually claimed for that amount of money~ yet~ Bank of America deducts the amount of that charge from my respective bank account, and IF the merchant does n't really ask or claim for that amount of money IN 5 DAYS, Bank of America deletes it from its Telephone Banking System. And this same item that had shown up in my online banking account page, showing as still \\\" processing '', has no Transaction Number assigned to it, but this amount is ADDED BACK INTO my bank account, AS IF THIS transaction had never taken place~ leading me to believe that I have more money in my balance than I really do! ~ because BOA knows that this merchant will rightfully come back at some future time and really claim for their money ( unless the bank puts it into a Claims Dispute, which has not happened to these charges, & BOA knows this ). THEN in either 3 or 6 or 10 or 12 days, when this same merchant decides to really claim for its money ( the charge I had made ), this merchant goes back to Bank of America & THIS TIME actually withdraws the money from my account, which then is reflected in my balance, of course. Again! SO BOA 's system of deducting, then adding back into my bank account in 5 days if the merchant has n't truly claimed for its money, then deducting same again in 6 or 10 days, is VERY misleading! Another PROBLEM associated with BOA 's accounting system is that, as I pointed out to a phone BOA teller this past Friday ( XXXX XXXX 2017 ), there is a duplication of this same transaction that then shows up on my online bank account balance page, where he could see that this charge is showing as \\\" processing '' which has NO transaction #, and yet at same time, it is showing on same page that it has been paid in actuality at some later time~ all of which is reflected in the current \\\" Available Balance ''. The problem here is that NO one could keep track of his or her account balance at BOA with this kind of misleading system & information! Hence, I have had multiple, multiple {$35.00} overdraft fees on all my 3 bank accounts with BOA, and while BOA has refunded some of them, many have NOT been refunded, and I have lost a tremendous amount of money because of this problem. I have repeatedly asked Bank of America to give us an ACCURATE balance on both its online and telephone banking system, and the various tellers & supervisors have said they think I have a good idea, and will \\\" pass it along '' to whom (? ) at BOA, but nothing is ever done about it! Bank of America has tried to tell me also that it is up to the merchant ( to whom I paid a charge for a service, or made a payment ) to provide a transaction number to the bank, but regardless of whether a merchant does this, BOA SHOULD provide US, their customers, a tracking number, because it is on ITS OWN WEBSITE, WHICH THEY DO HAVE CONTROL OVER! But BOA denies any responsibility for this! I have told BOA that regardless of what a merchant does, it is incumbent upon BOA, as OUR bank, to give us a transaction number, so that we can keep track of it, until it is finally paid! Otherwise, I am always on shifting ground, like quick-sand, with BOA 's flimsy & misleading accounting, whereby they deduct such a charge, which has not really been withdrawn YET, then when a merchant has n't claimed for its money in just 5 Days, BOA puts back into our account that money, & then when merchant decides in about a week later to claim for that money, the money is suddenly withdrawn again, and this time, legitimately, without any prior warning to me ( because by that time, BOA has wiped it off my telephone account balance system, and as to BOA 's online system, as mentioned above, the same transaction has been assigned NO transaction number whereby I can see IF it has been paid, and when ), the bottom in my bank account drops out, and I am charged {$35.00} overdraft fees! THIS is LUDICROUS! WHAT a slick system BOA is operating! ~ VERY clever on their part, as a way to scam its customers out of money with these MULTITUDINOUS {$35.00} overdraft fees assessed on millions of customers at BOA! ~ because of its fraudulent, misleading accounting system which gives us defective, inaccurate, & incomplete information! BOA is and can get rich collecting ALL these {$35.00} overdraft fees, when you consider how many transactions I do every week, PLUS if you multiply that TIMES the number of OTHER BOA customers who also have to put up with such a fraudulent accounting system! I am asking that BOA would refund all my {$35.00} overdraft fees, and until BOA will change its online & telephone bank account systems to provide customers with complete & accurate information on each & every transaction, I will not do any more business there. I have repeatedly asked BOA to have a feature on its telephone system, in which we would be able to dial a number on our phone for our actual true balance, where all my transactions have CLEARED my bank account, and then we can dial another number on our phone to get a list of all the PROCESSING or \\\" waiting in the wings to be paid '' charges, which would have a Transaction Number for each of them, which we could add up and KNOW to deduct from our actual true balance given on the other phone button. THIS is what I used to be able to do at XXXX XXXX ( I no longer bank there ). BOA just says that 's a good idea & then never does anything about it!!! Consequently, I have been caught in this misleading type of bank accounting system of BOA 's, to where I 've had to pay all these crazy {$35.00} overdraft fees!, which have caused me to go broke! On top of that, when I spoke with that telephone bank teller at BOA on Friday, XXXX XXXX, he was going to have a supervisor to call me back, to place a hold on my {$35.00} overdraft fees accrued on that & previous day, but NO one at BOA called me back, and even on Monday, after I 'd put more money into my accounts over the weekend, when their business dept is closed, so that I could cover for these {$35.00} charges coming in, I never got a call back, so I called BOA AGAIN on Monday to request for a Supervisor to call me back, but no one ever did. SO THEN I called at XXXX XXXX later that day, holding on phone for ONE HOUR to speak with one finally, and she said she was n't going to refund any of my {$35.00} overdraft fees. THAT is when I decided to contact CFPB, to see if you could intervene on my behalf, and ask them to refund all my {$35.00} overdraft fees, given their faulty & misleading bank accounting in which it is impossible for anyone to keep an accurate balance in our bank accounts, without having any transaction number assigned by BOA to each transaction, using our debit card~ plus the other problems with their balance system as described above. IF you need further information about this, please contact me at Cell XXXX. Thank you for helping me on this. I ca n't help but think many other BOA customers suffer under similar fraudulent & misleading accounting at BOA.

TD 's response \\\" While you are not charged an overdraft fee for a pending authorization, even if it brings your balance negative, the authorized funds are deducted from your available funds.

I contacted the bank and told that II was charged an OD Paid fee for the XXXX transaction according to TD banks representative which brought my negative balance to {$45.00} approximately. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - In reviewing my account this morning, I see that due to TD bank assessing the OD Paid fee, my deposits were wiped out and I have been assessed yet ANOTHER OD Paid fee for the {$10.00} XXXX charge - even though I took measures to ensure it was covered. \\n\\nI have requested from the bank the {$100.00} in fees be refunded as the information that I see online is inconsistent with the information they communicate AFTER they 're assessed the fee. They have refused. Also, they are charging fees based on the deduction of PENDING charges - money that has NOT been paid out to the merchant. \\nI did not want to take these drastic measures for fear of them closing my account, but I feel I have no choice as the customer service representatives obviously simply do not care.\",\"I have requested cancellation of FHA monthly mortgage insurance premium ( MIP ) on my mortgage loan, which is serviced by Nationstar.

I am declining to pay these charges based both on their invalidity, as clearly demonstrated by the facts, and because of the total refusal of both  XXXX  and  CapitalOne Visa to  ever investigate or respond to these facts.     I have spoken several times with customer service reps at both companies, who were uniformly polite and sympathetic. But when I put the details of the case in writing, as requested, correspondence received from both companies has show n ZERO in dication that they have even bothered to read what I wrote. They do not dispute the facts ; they deliberately ignore them and keep sending me copies of the rental contract. After several months of th is, CapitalOne Visa de clared the case closed because I had never sent them a copy of the contract the contract sent me more than once!     Attached documents describe exactly what happened and why their claims are invalid. Here is a summary to fit the space limits of this form : On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   I reserved a car from  XXXX  in  XXXX  for a same-day rental. {$58.00} was charged to my  XXXX  card ending in  XXXX . I picked up the car early Sunday,  XXXX   XXXX . During the outbound part of the trip, I began to experience difficulties with the clutch when shifting in to 1st g ear. These problems got worse on the way back, so much so that while at a rest stop between  XXXX  &  XXXX , it was clear that it would be dangerous to attempt to return to  XXXX  with the car.     We therefore phoned the number provided on the documentation at  XXXX . We were told that we would be picked up within an hour and that we would be taken to our home in  XXXX . We were picked up at  XXXX ,  2 hours and 15 m inutes after our initial call. Again, we were told they would get us back to  XXXX . We were towed to a spot by the side  of the road, som ewhere outside of  XXXX , and promised that a driver would come to take us back to  XXXX  within 30 minutes. No car ever came. We phoned again, at  XXXX , and were told a vehicle in fact had come for us but couldnt find the location and so had given up! Three more phone calls,  3  more promises, no pickup, and we were on the side  of the road in  the middle of nowhere. When the sun rose around  XXXX , we spotted a person along  the road who  told us how we might hike to a train station to get into  XXXX  . We took the car key to prevent theft, left a note on the windshield, and found our way to the train. The next day we went to their  XXXX   XXXX  office and returned the key.     Clearly the cars mechanical failure is not something that I should have to pay for. It should be noted that I have owned and driven stick shifts all my life. In  XXXX , I rented a stick shift car in  XXXX  thru  XXXX  for alm ost 4 wee ks, returning it the day before I reserved the car in  XXXX . Look this up :  XXXX   XXXX  voucher number  XXXX .   Im being charged for a lost key. Photo of a  XXXX  employee accepting return of the key attached.   Claim administration fees should not be charged to me because I am not responsible for any claims.   Unde r Witness Details CapitalOne i ndicates that there was none. As I told them repeatedly, my companion,  XXXX   XXXX , was with me the whole time and, with speaker phone on, we shared in all the phone conversations that long night with  XXXX .   To date, my credit card ending in  XXXX  has had the amounts {$740.00} unjustly charged to it, plus mounting interest fees.     I would think that  XXXX  would be offering some compensation for the ordeal they put  XXXX  and me through instead of billing me for their defective vehicle. At the very least, I would expect both  XXXX  and  CapitalOne Visa  to have responded to what I wrote rather than ignoring and bullying me.

They had absolutely no record of this in their files. They said I never called and changed my address, but I did. On top of that, they said the fraud investigation was closed and I had been refunded all of the money which was impossible because they only had access from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, and did n't have the completed packet from me to document fraud charges starting back in XX/XX/XXXX. After the man argued with me, they passed me on to a manager in the fraud department and I got them to resend me the packet to the updated address so I could fill it out.

They were offering loan modifications so we signed up. We had been in the house for 35 years and wanted to stay. That process of loan modification began a 2 year paperwork nightmare during which they told us to make {$1200.00} a month payments because that 's about what our future payments would be and we did. During the process they readily admitted they did not know exactly what they were doing. Eventually we were notified that our modified payments would be {$2200.00} a month, which is {$100.00} less than we had been paying before we started the modification process. The girl from citi actually said \\\" Whoops! Guess we got that wrong! '' In addition, they applied back interest so instead of owing XXXX we now had a mortgage of if memory serves {$230000.00}. They agreed to a short sale but would not modify our mortgage to {$170000.00} and let us keep the house. We let it fall into foreclosure and citi sold it for {$80000.00} since it had fallen into disrepair, a couple of years later to a house flipper. At the very end they transferred our mortgage to XXXX who tried to collect money from us.but somehow citi was still the bank that foreclosed. The house flipper spent about {$20000.00} to refurbish and sold it some poor unsuspecting person for {$400000.00}, more than {$50000.00} above appraised value. Citi ruined our lives by stringing us along for two years thinking we could keep our house with a loan modification and then making it impossible. It ruined our lives and we will never recover because at the time we were already into retirement age and now we are in our XXXX. I knew we were scammed but I could n't prove and still ca n't because I do n't know what went on behind the scenes. I suspects their confused and untrained representatives stuffed and maybe destroyed documents they had no idea what to do with. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have only now been able to rise above the devastation enough to put into words what little I know about what happened to us.If citi had been honest instead of stringing us along for years, we could have sold the house and walked away with, probably with no profit but at least without suffering forclosure and bankruptcy.\",\"This T-Mobile card was advertised with various benefits for T-Mobile wireless customers.

This has been a result of neglect, barriers, mis-handling, mis-processing, and lack of integrity in handling of consumer finance and credit matters by Citi. Below is a short summary : Citi has neglected to fairly or accurately handle and process verbal and written communications which, in fact at the extreme outcome, has resulted in closing my credit card account in good standing ; thereby denying access to credit and funds to my family and me. \\nCiti has not responded to written communications I have submitted asking them to explain why my credit card account in good standing was closed. \\nWhen I ask Citi to correct their mistake by reactivating/reopen my account - which they have negligently and erroneously closed - Citi threatened and required to pull my credit report again, thereby negatively affecting my credit reports. \\nCiti has systematically presented barriers to service my calls to their service centers pertaining to these and other matters with products they have issued to me. The company has failed and neglected to return calls promised to me by front line agents as call-back from supervisors in 24-48 hours. Supervisors are routinely not being made available on phone lines. These experiences and failed promises have repeated easily 4-6 times in just the recent 2-3 months. \\nCiti has abandoned a credit card product issued to me ( Citi XXXX XXXX XXXX ). They have forced me into a new product and new account ( Citi XXXX XXXX XXXX ). In this transition, I raised certain clarifications and requests pertaining to terms, conditions, and features. Citi refused and neglected to address my communications on this matter. Over several months I tried over phone and most recently in writing. \\nCiti 's consumer web login system and methods to make payments and schedule autopayments are generating errors, not updating in accurate or expected behavior, and are presenting barriers to payment, thereby triggering debt collection proceedings and other undesirable consequences to the consumer. \\nCiti 's new XXXX credit card partnership with a large retail merchant ( Costco ) to transitioning XXXX XXXX account holders resulted in a breakdown on previously set up autopayment, triggering harassing collection calls. In trying to resolve these matters, my calls to Citi 's service centers commonly were getting disconnected, Citi 's XXXX 's insisting automated phone payment without explanation or charges and blocking the phone calls from proceeding to live Citi customer service or collection representatives. \\nWhen Citi closes an account on their own and issues new products and accounts, for example in this case - as a result of new partnership Citi has formed with XXXX XXXX / XXXX or with Costco / XXXX ; the old accoun closure is flagged as Closed by Customer '', not as Closed by the Institution ''. Citi informed me that if they flag it as closed by them, then it is reported adversely to credit reports. This manner of flagging is inaccurate and lacks integrity in consumer credit and consumer financial record keeping. \\n\\nI started keeping logs and asking for identification of Citi staff I have been talking to on phone. Most recently I have spoken to the following individuals at Citi who have provided me ID 's which they claim to be theirs : XXXX ( ID XXXX ), XXXX ( ID XXXX in the Missouri XXXX ), XXXX ( ID XXXX ), XXXX ( ID XXXX ).\",\"I sent this complaint to the XXXX back in XXXX but wanted to advise you as well as the XXXX had no luck with this and these people continue to call me every single week threatening Criminal Prosecution : I have been receiving calls every week since XXXX/XXXX/2015.

I had a \\\" XXXX '' XXXX with First Tennessee Bank. At the completion of construction ( CO passed ), we had difficulty closing the permanent loan with First Tenn as we relayed to them several items not completed but had been paid for already by the bank. The bank 's duly designated inspector found no defects nor any issues with the construction. Closing was delayed and a second appraisal ordered by the bank. Throughout the construction, the bank colluded directly with the builder and moved money between line items without proper credits, documentation for invoices, nor sufficient communication with me. During the wait for the second appraisal, we found several construction code violations ( XXXX ), and Major Defects ( XXXX ) included in a punch list of XXXX items. The bank distanced itself, and I sought permanent loan financing elsewhere. During the search for new loan financing, the builder filed a lien on the home ( after we had taken posession of it while still working \\\" with '' First Tennessee, and prior to permanent loan financing ). First Tennessee then commenced a series of negligent errors costing us valuable time and damage to our credit rating including offering a \\\" blackmail '' version of a \\\" loan extension '' initially ( focused on relieving the bank of any liability due to their negligence ), followed by a series of \\\" after the fact '' ( back dated XXXX loan extensions with the end result of frustrating and scaring away potential permanent loan institutions due to Dodd-Frank issues and XXXX loan practices being significantly breached by First Tennessee.

During this same timeframe, the bank continued making loan errors, made up a fake agreement regarding a \\\" payment plan '', then engaged in false credit reporting by submitting a false supplemental credit report stating we were in default and late paying the \\\" fake payment plan '' XXXX fake = never spoken of by either party, nor agreed to. This according to the XXXX XXXX personally handling our account ). The bank also doled out loan extensions, always after the due date of the previous extension, AND always back-dated as if the loan had never lapsed into default, which new institutions were rightfully not willing to accept. This entire process took place due to First Tennessee negligence in accounting, project oversight, inspections, and contract practices, illegal loan extension agreements, blackmail in the form of an initial \\\" loan extension agreement '' who 's sole purpose was relieving the bank of liability for its illegal and unethical actions, and engaging in false credit reporting.

The credit bureaus are so out of compliance with existing laws and they have caused me so much damage with lost credit and higher costs of credit, that they should be required to send me my credit reports to the same address they have sent them to for years. They have acted hostilely to me for years and can not be trusted. Furthermore, they are not entitled to record, keep or provide my social security number and birthdate to third parties, yet they do so relentlessly against my written directions to cease and desist from doing so, exposing me to unwanted risks to my privacy, identity theft, cyber crime from all over the world, and enormous, unwarranted, credit difficulties.\",\"I am a former XXXX student. I took out their private Genesis loan when I XXXX applied in 2012. I was promised flexible repayment options and an easy manageable monthly payment. It was all going well until XXXX and XXXX of this year when I suddenly found myself short on money. I was denied a deferement for the XXXX dollar charge, so I did what I could, and in the span of a week paid XXXX XXXX dollar payments to cut down on the now past due payment of 340 dollars. Despite paying XXXX XXXX dollar payments to Genesis Lending in the span of just one week, my balance for XXXX still reads 340 dollars. Now I am aware that companies send late payments towards interest charges instead of the actual loan amount, but the fact that even after XXXX payments in one week led to absolutely no reduction in the extravagant payment leads me to reconsider what this so called fair and honest company does with my hard earned money. I consider myself lucky enough to have a job in the field I had studied for but it was all due to my own searching, the school never helped me with a solid lead for a career, and I feel very cheated by Genesis lending.

Furthermore, in my belief, the firm refused to reopen my original account via their appeal process because I decided to submit the original CFPB Complaint when the firm had not complied with their turn around time frames to communicate with me regarding the appeal status ; the oversight/submitting manager even asked me not to submit the CFPB Complaint yet. \\n\\nThis new complaint is because of Capital One Bank ( 'Firm ' ) being deceptive, abusive, retaliatory, and financially harmful to me from XXXX of 2016 to current, XXXX of 2016. \\nOn XXXX XXXX, 2016, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX XXXX Capital One Bank to apply for an unsecured credit card with \\\" Good Odds '' of approval. XXXX 2016, a multitude of Capital One firm agents advised me that my original/secured credit card account was closed due to returned payments and secured credit card accounts can never be reopened, no matter if a bank error was the closure cause ; therefore regardless of my appeal outcome, I was still eligible to apply for another Capital One Credit Card account. With the advice and permission of firm agents, as well as, direct solicitation from firm itself to apply for a new credit card account ; I did so on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and was immediately approved for a XXXX XXXX, unsecured revolving credit card account ( Second Capital One Account/Credit Card ). \\n\\nUpon approval, the firm emailed me confirmations and automatically linked the new account to my pre-existing online profile which includes to this day, the first closed credit card. Approximately XXXX5 days later, I received my XXXX credit card in the mail ; then activating the card with my name associated with it. Since activation of the card and account, I 've made many purchases and have since submitted XXXX ACH Payments that were sent via my bank, XXXX XXXX and have cleared. On XXXX 2016, the firm without notice, decided to close my newly opened credit account. The reason that I was given was because of recent returned payments, which can only be true for the prior account that was closed and not of this second account. \\n\\nThis is unfair, deceptive and abusive practices by advising & direct soliciting me that I am eligible to apply for credit card products. Once I do apply for a credit card product, the firm approves the application, sends me the new account cards, allows and consents to activation of the new credit card account, as well as debit transactions and accepts my successful payments. After all of this, the firm then closes this newly approved credit card account without notice to me until I attempted to use the credit card at a grocery store and it was decline per a restriction to close the account. The first case and closure on XXXX XXXX, 2016 has caused very negative impacts to my Credit reports ( CBR 's ) and their credit scores per the account closure and then now there 's another hard inquiry on my CBR and there will be another credit card closure per credit grantor/lender. This looks very negative to other creditors that will review my CBRs and will impact me for years to come. I 've also incurred an annual fee of {$39.00} on the newly approved/activated credit card. \\n\\nViolations include, but not limited to : Fair Lending Act- Reg B ; Reg Z- Truth in Lending ; Fair Credit Reporting ( FCRA ) ; Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ).\",\"XXXX  and  Transunion  are reporting tax liens on my credit report the liens are incorrect and I have no outstanding liability or overdue taxes with the state of Georgia.TYPE Tax lien COURT NUMBER  XXXX  CASE NUMBER  XXXX  DATE FILED  XXXX ,   XXXX   AMOUNT {$1900.00} PLAINTIFF  XXXX  ACCOUNT HOLDER Individual COURT NUMBER  XXXX  CASE NUMBER  XXXX  DATE FILED  XXXX ,  XXXX  AMOUNT {$4500.00}\",\"I attended a years worth of training at the XXXX school XXXX XXXX XXXX, out in XXXX XXXX, California, as well as an additional 4 months of training specifically for XXXX, under the same institution. For a small portion of my tuition, I was able to receive federal loans, but the majority I had to apply for private loans - this goes for the original years worth of standard training, as well as my extended training. My only choice at the time was to go through SallieMae, and I had cosigners who helped me attain the loans. Upon graduation I was able to enjoy the grace period and began making payments afterwards. I worked for about 4 months before I lost my XXXX job. I was able to get a job by the end of the same month, but was making substantially less. I was making payments to SallieMae at the time without issue. Times grew harder, and the decreased pay really began to catch up with me. I picked up a XXXX job, but was still struggling to make payments on all my loans, as well as necessities for daily living. I requested forbearance with SallieMae, to which they complied. I was given 3 months grace until I had to make payments again. During those three months, I received multiple calls with SallieMae telling me that I was past due by one full month, or two full months, and they were demanding payment. Each time I would inform them that I had already signed up for forbearance and that I was n't to make payments until the end of that period. They would tell me that they would make note of it and the call would end. I received these calls XXXX or XXXX a month during the forbearance period, and worse, so did my cosigners. My cosigners would be forced into making payments because they were unaware of the conditions of the forbearance. I would call SallieMae and request that they stop collecting payment and asked why they were doing so when my loans were clearly in forbearance, even my online profile listed the document that explained the terms and conditions of the forbearance. \\n\\nAfter that period of forbearance ended, I made payments for month but still needed more time and reenlisted in forbearance for a XXXX time. Another XXXX months with the same issues - debt collection calls, claims that I am past due and have a delinquent account, and my cosigners would also receive the same calls. The issues persisted throughout the forbearance and after the last month I began to make payments again, as necessary, for 4 months. At this time, I received a degradation to my pay, and was earning even less money. I could not comfortably meet the payment requirements and requested an additional forbearance period. I was informed this was the last time I could enroll in forbearance, but I had no choice and agreed. At this time, I enlisted XXXX loans under SallieMae at the same time. My cosigner received many calls stating that I was delinquent on the account and payment was necessary, to which they would pay, and I was misinformed in the fact that XXXX loan was put into forbearance before the other. To my understanding I had to make a payment on XXXX loans and that XXXX would go into forbearance at the same time, and payments would resume in XXXX. After XXXX, my account was listed as delinquent with a past due payment of {$500.00}, which I could not pay at the time and was far above my standard payment. I inquired to it and was given the explanation that XXXX loan went into forbearance before the other and that my only option was to pay off the amount. I had received no statement for the account for the month of XXXX, and a statement is n't even listed on my SallieMae account profile. The same goes for XXXX. I am now {$1000.00} behind and am given no options other than SallieMae demanding repayment. I am at a loss and can not make this payment.

    "Inspired by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the word2vec model is expanded to simultaneously learn word, document and topic vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lda2vec is obtained by modifying the skip-gram word2vec variant. In the original skip-gram method, the model is trained to predict context words based on a pivot word. In lda2vec, the pivot word vector and a document vector are added to obtain a context vector. This context vector is then used to predict context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of integrating context vectors in the word2vec model is not a new idea. Paragraph vectors, for example, also explored this idea in order to learn fixed-length representations of variable-length text fragments. In their work, for each text fragment (size of a paragraph) a dense vector representation is learned, similar to the learned word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that the context/paragraph vectors resemble typical word vectors, making them less interpretable as, for example, the output of LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lda2vec model goes one step beyond the paragraph vector approach by working with document-sized text fragments and decomposing the document vectors into two different components. In the same spirit as the LDA model, a document vector is decomposed into a document weight vector and a topic matrix. The document weight vector represents the percentage of the different topics, whereas the topic matrix consists of the different topic vectors. A context vector is thus constructed by combining the different topic vectors that occur in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example: in the original word2vec model, if the pivot word is 'French', then possible context words might be 'German', 'Dutch', 'English'. Without any global (document-related) information, these would be the most plausible guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing an additional context vector in the lda2vec model, it is possible to make better guesses of context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the document vector is a combination of the ‘food’ and ‘drinks’ topics, then 'baguette', 'cheese' and 'wine' might be more suitable. If the document vector is similar to the 'city' and ‘geography’ topics, then 'Paris', 'Lyon' and 'Grenoble' might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these topic vectors are learned in word space, which allows for easy interpretation: you simply look at the word vectors that are closest to the topic vectors. In addition, constraints are put on the document weight vectors, to obtain a sparse vector (similar to LDA), instead of a dense vector. This enables easy interpretation of the topic content of different documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the end-result of the lda2vec is a set of sparse document weight vectors, as well as easily interpretable topic vectors."
